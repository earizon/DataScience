 Microsoft Cognitive Services makes it super easy to use AI in your
own solution. The toolset includes services like searching for images
and entities, analyzing images for recognizing objects or faces,
language or speech services, etc. The default Vision service allows
us to upload an image which will be analyzed and it returns a JSON
object that holds detailed information about the image. For example,
if an image contains any faces, what the landscape is, what the
recognized objects are, etc.

The Custom Vision service will give you more control of what
specifically should be recognized in an image. The way it works is
that in the portal of the Custom Vision service you have the option
to upload images and tag them. Let’s, for instance, pretend that
you want to recognize if uploaded images are either a Mercedes or a
Bentley car. You’ll need to create two tags, Mercedes and Bentley,
upload images and connect them to the respective tags. After that,
it’s time to train the model. Under the hood, machine learning is
used to train and improve the model. The more images you upload the
more accurate the model becomes and that’s how it works with most
of the machine learning models. In the end, it’s all about data and
verifying your model. After the model is all set, it’s time to
upload images and test the results. The Custom Vision service analyze
the images and return the tags with a probability percentage.

At a presentation during Google I/O 2019, Google announced TensorFlow
Graphics, a library for building deep neural networks for
unsupervised learning tasks in computer vision. The library contains
3D-rendering functions written in TensorFlow, as well as tools for
learning with non-rectangular mesh-based input data.
