Model Serving (Executing Trained Models)

● Importing/Exporting Models: PMML formal, TODO

● Keras vs. PyTorch Export:
https://deepsense.ai/keras-or-pytorch/
- What are the options for exporting and deploying your trained models
  in production?
- PyTorch saves models in Pickles, Python-only-compatible.
  - Exporting models is harder and currently the widely
    recommended approach is to start by translating
    PyTorch models to Caffe2 using ONNX.
- Kera can opt opt for:
  - JSON + H5 files (though saving with custom layers in
    Keras is generally more difficult).
  - Keras in R.
  - Tensorflow export utilities with Tensorflow backend.
    ("protobuf") allowing to export to Mobile (Android, iOS, IoT)
   and TensorFlow Lite (Web Browser, TensorFlow.js or keras.js).
