· GeoJSON is a format for representing geographic objects. It’s
  different from regular JSON because it supports geometry types, such
  as: Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLineString,
  MultiPolygon, and GeometryCollection.
· Using GeoJSON, making visualizations becomes suddenly easier, as
  you’ll see in a later section. This is primarily because GeoJSON
  allows us to store collections of geometric data types in one central
  structure.
· GeoPandas is a Python module used to make working with geospatial
  data in python easier by extending the datatypes used by the Python
  module pandas to allow spatial operations on geometric types.
