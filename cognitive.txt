Last year we released the Transformer, a new machine learning model that
showed remarkable success over existing algorithms for machine translation
and other language understanding tasks. Before the Transformer, most neural
network based approaches to machine translation relied on recurrent neural
networks (RNNs) which operate sequentially (e.g. translating words in a
sentence one-after-the-other) using recurrence (i.e. the output of each step
feeds into the next). While RNNs are very powerful at modeling sequences,
their sequential nature means that they are quite slow to train, as longer
sentences need more processing steps, and their recurrent structure also
makes them notoriously difficult to train properly.

In contrast to RNN-based approaches, the Transformer used no recurrence,
instead processing all words or symbols in the sequence in parallel while
making use of a self-attention mechanism to incorporate context from words
farther away. By processing all words in parallel and letting each word
attend to other words in the sentence over multiple processing steps, the
Transformer was much faster to train than recurrent models. Remarkably, it
also yielded much better translation results than RNNs. However, on smaller
and more structured language understanding tasks, or even simple algorithmic
tasks such as copying a string (e.g. to transform an input of “abc” to “abcabc
”), the Transformer does not perform very well. In contrast, models that
perform well on these tasks, like the Neural GPU and Neural Turing Machine,
fail on large-scale language understanding tasks like translation.
