● PyCaret: [[{pycaret,low_code,python,101]]
@[https://pycaret.org/]
low-code Machine Learning Framework
- Increased Productivity
  PyCaret being a low-code library makes you more productive. With
  less time spent coding, you and your team can now focus on business
  problems.
- Easy to Use
    PyCaret is simple and easy to use machine learning library that
  will help you to perform end-to-end ML experiments with less lines of
  code.
- Business Ready
    PyCaret is a business ready solution. It allows you to do
  prototyping quickly and efficiently from your choice of notebook
  environment.

● Ml: automl has a project’s life cycle, 
which includes data cleaning, feature selection/engineering, model 
selection, parameter optimization, and finally, model validation. 
#AutoML came to automate the entire process from data cleaning to 
parameter optimization. There are multiple solutions.

● (ML Very low code) Pycaret + Gradio tutorial   [[{01_PM.low_code]]
https://towardsdatascience.com/supercharge-your-machine-learning-experiments-with-pycaret-and-gradio-5932c61f80d9 
  PyCaret is an alternate low-code library that can be used to replace 
  hundreds of lines of code with few lines only. This makes the experiment cycle exponentially fast and efficient.PyCaret is simple and easy to use. All the operations performed in PyCaret are 
  sequentially stored in a Pipeline that is fully automated for 
  deployment. Whether it’s imputing missing values, one-hot-encoding, 
  transforming categorical data, feature engineering, or even 
  hyperparameter tuning, PyCaret automates all of it.To learn more 
  about PyCaret, check out their GitHub. GradioGradio is an open-source 
  Python library for creating customizable UI components around your 
  machine learning models. Gradio makes it easy for you to “play 
  around” with your model in your browser by dragging and dropping in 
  your own images, pasting your own text, recording your own voice, 
  etc., and seeing what the model outputs.Gradio is useful for:Creating 
  quick demos around your trained ML pipelinesGetting live feedback on 
  model performanceDebugging your model interactively during 
  developmentTo learn more about Gradio, check out their GitHub.

● ML: ApaflowAPAflow (Advanced and Predictive Analytics Flow) is a 
free desktop application for Windows for data science and machine 
learning built on top of PyCaret and H2O. APAflow is built for data 
analysis, data preparation, feature engineering, model development,

● ML: PyCaret timeseries modulePyCaret Time Series Module
   What you see below is the output from the compare_models of our new 
  (in-making) time series module. PyCaret Time Series Module will be an 
  easy-to-use forecasting tool built on top of sktime, fbprophet, 
  statsmodels, and few others. This module will have both the existing 
  functional API as well as a new OOP API that supports object-oriented 
  programing. Time Series module has a rich model zoo containing 
  classical statistical models such as ARIMA, SARIMA, ETS, TBATS, etc. 
  as well as all the models from the regression module. Regressors are 
  used with a technique called Reduction Method which converts 
  univariate time series into tabular data.This module comes with 50+ 
  pre-built pipelines with target transformations. The inference will 
  be through the predict_model function. A bunch of plotting and 
  analysis functionality, auto logging via MLFlow, and deployment 
  capabilities.Hyperparameter tuning is auto with the tune_model 
  function just like the other modules in PyCaret. This module is a 
  result of tireless efforts and hard work by Nikhil Gupta Miguel Trejo
