Apache Spark:

- Monitoring with InfluxDB:
REF @[https://www.infoq.com/articles/spark-application-monitoring-influxdb-grafana]
  - Uber has recently open sourced their  JVM Profiler for Spark .
    In this article we will discuss how we can extend Uber JVM Profiler
    and use it with InfluxDB and Grafana for monitoring and reporting the
    performance metrics of a Spark application.

- StreamSets:
  - project aiming at simplifing pipeline creation
    and dataflow visualization.
  - configuration-oriented gui
  - very easy to configure new pipeline in no-time.
  - cluster mode to run on top of Spark.
  - ability to change data routes in hot mode
  - Allows to run custom Python and Spark scripts to
    process the data.

# Spark ML:

  In this article, we will discuss a technique called Consensus
Clustering to assess the stability of clusters generated by a
clustering algorithm with respect to small perturbations in the data
set. We will review a sample application built using the Apache Spark
machine learning library to show how consensus clustering can be used
with K-means, Bisecting K-means, and Gaussian Mixture, three distinct
clustering algorithms
