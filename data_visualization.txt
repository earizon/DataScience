● Seaborn: Stat Graphs: [[{]]
  Michael Waskom’s package providing very high-level
  wrappers for complex plots (ggplot2-like aesthetic)
  over matplotlib
@[https://seaborn.pydata.org/]
- a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative
  statistical graphics on top of matplotlib.

● Bokeh ( Python to interactive JS charts):
- (Continuum Analytics)
- "potential game-changer for web-based visualization".
- Bokeh generates static JavaScript and JSON for you
  from Python code, so  your users are magically able
  to interact with your plots on a webpage without you
  having to write a single line of native JS code.

● Plotly Charts:

● Graph Visualization: [[{ graph_networks ]]
  - Gephi
  - Cytoscape
  - D3.js
  - Linkurious.
- The graph visualization tools usually offer ways of representing
  graph structure and properties, interactive ways to manipulate those
  and reporting mechanisms to extract and visualize value from the
  information contained in them.

● Orange GUI!!  
@[https://orange.biolab.si/]
- Open source machine learning and data visualization for novice and expert.
- Interactive data analysis workflows with a large toolbox.
  Perform simple data analysis with clever data visualization. Explore
  statistical distributions, box plots and scatter plots, or dive deeper with
  decision trees, hierarchical clustering, heatmaps, MDS and linear projections.
  Even your multidimensional data can become sensible in 2D, especially with
  clever attribute ranking and selections.
