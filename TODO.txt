#  101 It crazy how far the ML field has come when it comes to fine-tuning LLMs. [[{]]
Post by Leandro von Werra @ Linked In

A year ago: it was challenging to fine-tune GPT-2 (1.5B) on a single GPU without looking into DeepSpeed, Megatron or other distributing frameworks which are their own beasts to tame.

Today: You can train Llama 2 7B on a T4 GPU which you get for free on Google Colab or even train the 70B model on a single A100?

How? The power of 4bit quantization and QLoRA which are easily accessible via bitsandbytes and the peft libraries! You can use the following snippet to train any llama model on your own dataset with minimal infrastructure!

pip install trl
git clone https://github.com/lvwerra/trl

python trl/examples/scripts/sft_trainer.py \
  --model_name meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf \
  -- dataset_name timdettmers/openassistant-guanaco \
  --load_in_4bit \
  --use_peft \
  --batch_size 4 \
  --gradient_accumulation_steps 2

  In this amazing blog post, Jay Mody implements GPT-2 from scratch
using numpy. He then loads the official weights from OpenAI and
executes some experiments.But how he manages to add multi-GPU
support? The answer is jax and surprisingly is trivial to convert his
numpy code into jax.Github:

# PEFT: Paramete Efficient Fine-tunning [[{]]

Full fine-tuning of LLMs is insane, But which PEFT to choose? A brute-force technique to try all is not practical. Having a mental model helps, here we go.

> Prompt Tuning:

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁: Prompt Tuning involves learning a set of continuous, trainable params that modify the pre-trained LLM's hidden states in response to task-specific prompts during inference, effectively fine-tuning the model at inference time.

𝗪𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝘁𝗼 𝘂𝘀𝗲: When you want to fine-tune it for 𝙢𝙪𝙡𝙩𝙞𝙥𝙡𝙚 𝙙𝙞𝙛𝙛𝙚𝙧𝙚𝙣𝙩 𝙙𝙤𝙬𝙣𝙨𝙩𝙧𝙚𝙖𝙢 𝙩𝙖𝙨𝙠𝙨 𝙖𝙩 𝙞𝙣𝙛𝙚𝙧𝙚𝙣𝙘𝙚 𝙩𝙞𝙢𝙚 𝙬𝙞𝙩𝙝 𝙢𝙞𝙣𝙞𝙢𝙖𝙡 𝙘𝙤𝙢𝙥𝙪𝙩𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣𝙖𝙡 𝙧𝙚𝙨𝙤𝙪𝙧𝙘𝙚𝙨. It is also useful when you want to generate diverse and high-quality text outputs based on specific prompts.

→ 𝗟𝗼𝗥𝗔:

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁: LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) is a technique that modifies the pre-trained LLM's attention mechanism during fine-tuning by introducing a low-rank matrix factorization that learns task-specific attention patterns.

𝗪𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝘁𝗼 𝘂𝘀𝗲: When you want to fine-tune for a 𝙨𝙥𝙚𝙘𝙞𝙛𝙞𝙘 𝙙𝙤𝙬𝙣𝙨𝙩𝙧𝙚𝙖𝙢 𝙩𝙖𝙨𝙠 𝙩𝙝𝙖𝙩 𝙧𝙚𝙦𝙪𝙞𝙧𝙚𝙨 𝙩𝙖𝙨𝙠-𝙨𝙥𝙚𝙘𝙞𝙛𝙞𝙘 𝙖𝙩𝙩𝙚𝙣𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣 𝙥𝙖𝙩𝙩𝙚𝙧𝙣𝙨.

→ 𝗔𝗱𝗮𝗽𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀:

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁: Adapters are tiny NN modules that are added to pre-trained LLMs, typically between the pre-trained layers, to adapt the model to new downstream tasks. During fine-tuning, only the weights of the adapter are learned, while the pre-trained model's parameters remain fixed.

𝗪𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝘁𝗼 𝘂𝘀𝗲: When you need to fine-tune 𝙢𝙪𝙡𝙩𝙞𝙥𝙡𝙚 𝙙𝙤𝙬𝙣𝙨𝙩𝙧𝙚𝙖𝙢 𝙩𝙖𝙨𝙠𝙨 𝙤𝙣 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙨𝙖𝙢𝙚 𝙥𝙧𝙚-𝙩𝙧𝙖𝙞𝙣𝙚𝙙 𝙢𝙤𝙙𝙚𝙡. Additionally, Adapters are flexible and can be quickly and easily plugged into different parts of the pre-trained model without requiring major modifications.

→ 𝗣𝗿𝗲𝗳𝗶𝘅 𝗧𝘂𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴:

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁: Prefix tuning involves adding a small trainable prefix to the input of the pre-trained LLM during fine-tuning, which modifies the representation learned by the pre-trained model to better suit the downstream task.

𝗪𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝘁𝗼 𝘂𝘀𝗲: When you want to fine-tune a pre-trained LLM for a 𝙨𝙥𝙚𝙘𝙞𝙛𝙞𝙘 𝙙𝙤𝙬𝙣𝙨𝙩𝙧𝙚𝙖𝙢 𝙩𝙖𝙨𝙠 𝙖𝙣𝙙 𝙝𝙖𝙫𝙚 𝙡𝙞𝙢𝙞𝙩𝙚𝙙 𝙘𝙤𝙢𝙥𝙪𝙩𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣𝙖𝙡 𝙧𝙚𝙨𝙤𝙪𝙧𝙘𝙚𝙨 𝙬𝙝𝙚𝙣 𝙮𝙤𝙪 𝙬𝙖𝙣𝙩 𝙩𝙤 𝙢𝙤𝙙𝙞𝙛𝙮 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙧𝙚𝙥𝙧𝙚𝙨𝙚𝙣𝙩𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣 learned by the pre-trained model for a particular task.

# Stacking algorithm: [[{ml,101,01_PM.TODO]]
- Stacking is an ensemble learning technique to combine multiple
  classification models via a meta-classifier. The individual
  classification models are trained based on the complete training set;
  then, the meta-classifier is fitted based on the outputs
  (meta-features) of the individual classification models in the
  ensemble. The meta-classifier can either be trained on the predicted
  class labels or probabilities from the ensemble.

  Amazon's Alexa Science researchers published a paper providing a
  theoretical basis for neural-network optimization. While showing that
  it is computationally intractable to find a perfect solution, the
  paper does provide a formulation, the Approximate Architecture Search
  Problem (a-ASP), that can be solved with genetic algorithms.

# CPU faster than GPU scenarios(search/Hash tables) [[{02_doc_has.comparative,scalability]]
https://techdecoded.intel.io/resources/the-role-and-potential-of-cpus-in-deep-learning/
   CPUs are more suitable for such applications with limited
  parallelism because of their advanced memory management techniques.
  For example, researchers from Rice University have shown that for
  fully connected networks over sparse datasets such as Amazon-670K,
  and Delicious-200K, the DL training problem can be modeled as a
  search problem:
  This allows replacing matrix multiplication operation with
  hash tables  allowing CPU to provide higher performance than
  a TensorFlow-based implementation on GPU.

# MIT Researchers Open-Source Approximate Matrix Multiplication Algorithm MADDNESS [[{scalability]]
  https://www.infoq.com/news/2021/10/mit-matrix-multiplication/ 
  Matrix multiplication is a fundamental operation in machine
  learning, and is one of the most time-consuming, due to the extensive
  use of multiply-add instructions. Because GPU and TPU chips can
  execute many multiply-adds in parallel, they perform matrix
  multiplication faster than CPUs, making them attractive for ML
  applications; however, they may be too expensive or even unavailable
  for researchers with a limited budget, or in resource-constrained
  applications like IoT. Thus, many researchers have investigated AMM
  algorithms, which trade off accuracy of matrix multiplication for
  speed.

    The team described MADDNESS and a set of experiments in a paper
  presented at the recent International Conference on Machine Learning
  (ICML). Unlike many other AMM algorithms, MADDNESS uses no
  multiply-add operations. Instead, MADDNESS uses a set of efficient
  learned hash functions that achieve coding rates of 100GB/second
  using only one CPU thread. The hash functions map input data to an
  index into a lookup table that contains pre-computed dot-products.
  Although the algorithm does introduce some output error, the authors
  show the algorithm has a theoretical upper-bound on the error, which
  can be traded-off against speed. In a set of experiments comparing
  the performance of MADDNESS against other algorithms in an image
  classifier, the researchers found that MADDNESS has a better
  speed-accuracy tradeoff, and achieves "virtually the same accuracy as
  exact multiplication" while being 10x faster.

# R vs python, by Keith McNulty
Expert Mathematician, Applied Statistician, Psychometrician, Data Scientist
   If you are new to programming and If your priority is deeply
  understanding statistical relationships, you may wish to start with
  #rstats. If your priority is running predictions of a phenomenon with
  a minimum amount of code you may wish to start with #python
  especially if you are already familiar with object-oriented
  principles. But if you are committed, over time eventually you’ll
  learn both because they are both very interesting and capable

... R is a purpose designed environment for statistical modelling, inference and many other related things.
 R also happens to be a programming language, and Turing-complete, but not a general purpose one,
having been designed to work within the R framework; a bit like VBA being associated with Excel and other
MS applications.

Holger K. von Jouanne-Diedrich
I am a professor ... I don't agree. When you want to learn data science with Python you basically
have to learn two languages, with R only one because it was designed for that matter.

Especially with technologies like Docker, which allow Data Scientists to develop their applications in
pretty much any language they are comfortable with, and then pass on to engineers, who will know what
to do next.

  IF “UNDERSTAND THE PHENOMENON” MEANS FITTING PARAMETRIC MODEL THEN YES.
  IT IS CALLED STATISTICS, R IS CERTAINLY BETTER FOR STATISTICS BECAUSE IT WAS DEVELOPED BY STATISTICIANS FOR STATISTICIANS..
  BUT FUNDAMENTALLY IT IS NOT ABOUT WHICH LANGUAGE TO USE. IT IS ABOUT MAKING QUALITY PREDICTIONS.
  MACHINE LEARNING MOVED PAST PARAMETRIC MODELS AND IS USING DATA DRIVEN PREDICTIONS BECAUSE
  THE MAIN GOAL OF ANY MODEL IS NOT TO FIT A CONTRIVED PARAMETRIC MODEL TO THE DATASET,
  BUT TO PREDICT WELL OUT OF SAMPLE TO GENERATE VALUE.

   ALL PARAMETRIC MODELLING DOES IS GIVING FALSE SENSE OF "MASTERING THE DATA" BY FITTING GAUSSIAN AND
  OTHER CLASSICAL DISTRIBUTIONS TO DATA THAT, UNLESS BEING SYNTHETIC, NEVER FOLLOWS SUCH DISTRIBUTIONS.
   AND THE RESULT IS MODEL MISMATCH RESULTING IN INCORRECT AND BIASED PREDICTIONS.
    SO WOULD ONE REALLY PREFER TO "UNDERSTAND" THE DATA (AS IN FITTING PARAMETRIC MODEL)
  OR HAVE MUCH BETTER PREDICTIONS THAT GENERATE BUSINESS VALUE?
  DEPENDS ON PERSPECTIVE, “UNDERSTAND” WORKS WELL IN SCHOOL STATISTICS 1.01 CLASSES AND ACADEMIA,
  BUT IS NOT VERY USEFUL TO GENERATE BUSINESS VALUE VIA BETTER PREDICTIONS.

I find this statement fundamentally wrong, I am doing both descriptive and predictive solely with R
(and deploy it on production). And definitely, nowadays, you can do both with Python.
There are some applications that may available in one but not on the other, and this a good motivation
for focusing on one out the two.

Adrian Olszewski
Principal Biostatistician at 2KMM CRO, Clinical Research with R
 My field is a good example. The community didn't care and overslept one of the most prestigious
and beneficial industries the Clinical Research (drug evaluation and approval),
)LETTING SAS AND R TO CONSTITUTE TWO DE FACTO INDUSTRY STANDARDS (SAS - the absolute majority, R - supportive yet,
 as it still lacks a few key features).
 Actually, a similar thing happens to R. SAS has all the stuff required by the industry,
so people choose it rather than bringing the stuff to R. Luckily, as R was present in Pharma for decades,
they started contributing a lot recently, yet a lot is still to be done.

Jason Cherry
...As time has gone on the divergence of analytical capabilities between the two languages has decreased.
I will say that ggplot is still way better than anything comparable dataviz-wise in Python,
but those cases are rarer and rarer.
For me, I chose Python because of the libraries that exist for it are more general-purpose.
 I can not only build a fully-functioning analytical solution in Python, but I can wrap it in
a REST API and spin that up more easily as a containerized solution that plays nice with other
functionality it may need to interact with.
 R has some functionality here too, but it's lagging behind enough that I really do prefer Python
in a setting where I'm working on something that could have a pipeline to production, and/or
I'm working with software engineers at some point of the project.

Alberto Almuiña
There are also some time series methods that are not implemented in Python, such as the
multiple seasonal decomposition from the forecast package and others.

Keith McNulty Expert Mathematician, Applied Statistician, Psychometrician, Data Scientist
In Python last time I looked you can NOT do proportional odds regression for the purposes
of inference in stats-models although they do have a version for predictive classification.
 And mixed GLMs don’t exist. Also major limitations on tests of significant coefficient
difference like the wald test. Also no packages for effect sizes.
  R is still working towards a mature consistent framework for predictive analytics.
The tidymodels ecosystem is making progress but it is not at the Python level yet.

  data using machine learning. In particular, we are interested in
  estimating the causal effect of treatment T on the outcome Y of an
  individual characterized by features X. In experimental data with
  binary treatments and binary outcomes, this is equivalent to
  estimating Pr(Y=1 | T=1, X=x) - Pr(Y=1 | T=0, X=x).Thanks to the

# Stan (Stats Inference):
  @[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_(software)]
  Stan is a probabilistic programming language for statistical
  inference written in C++.[1] The Stan language is used to specify a
  (Bayesian) statistical model with an imperative program calculating
  the log probability density function.[1]

  Named in honour of Stanislaw Ulam, pioneer of the Monte Carlo method.

  Stan was created by a development team consisting of 34 members
  that includes Andrew Gelman, Bob Carpenter, Matt Hoffman, and Daniel
  Lee.

  Interfaces

  Stan can be accessed through several interfaces:

      CmdStan    - command-line executable for the shell
      RStan      - integration with the R software environment, maintained
                   by Andrew Gelman and colleagues
      PyStan     - integration with the Python programming language
      MatlabStan - integration with the MATLAB numerical computing
                   environment
      Stan.jl    - integration with the Julia programming language
      StataStan  - integration with Stata

  @[https://mc-stan.org/]

  Stan is a state-of-the-art platform for statistical modeling and
  high-performance statistical computation.
  - Use cases:
    - statistical modeling
    - data analysis
    - prediction in social, biological, physical sciences, engineering, and business.

  Users specify log density functions in Stan's probabilistic programming language and get:
  - full Bayesian statistical inference with MCMC sampling (NUTS, HMC)
  - approximate Bayesian inference with variational inference (ADVI)
  - penalized maximum likelihood estimation with optimization (L-BFGS)
  - Stan's math library provides differentiable probability functions&linear algebra
    (C++ autodiff).
    - Additional R packages provide expression-based linear modeling,
      posterior visualization, and leave-one-out cross-validation.

# Pyro: Deep Universal Probabilistic Programming
  @[http://pyro.ai/]
  REF(ES): @[https://www.datanalytics.com/2019/10/14/pyro/]
  "Stan en Python y a escala...
  ... parece que su especialidad es la inferencia variacional estocástica.
  Que parece funcionar de la siguiente manera. En el MCMC tradicional
  uno obtiene una muestra de la distribución (a posteriori, para los amigos)
  de los parámetros de interés. Eso es todo: vectores de puntos.
  En la inferencia variacional estocástica, uno preespecifica la forma
  paramétrica de la posteriori y el algoritmo calcula sus parámetros
  a partir de los valores simulados. Por ejemplo, uno va y dice:
  me da que la distribución del término independiente de mi regresión lineal
  va a ser normal. Entonces, Pyro responde: si es normal, la mejor media
  y desviación estándar que encuentro son tal y cual.

  La segunda observación que me permito hacer es que la forma que adquiere la
  implementación de modelos en Pyro está muy alejada de la forma en que los
  plantearía un estadístico. Uno lee código en Stan o Jags y entiende lo
  que está ocurriendo: las servidumbres al lenguaje subyacente son mínimas y
  existe un DSL conciso que permite expresar los modelos de una manera natural.
  Pero no pasa así con Pyro. "

# SnakeMake: create reproducible and scalable data analyses  [[qa]]
@[https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/]
The Snakemake workflow management system is a tool to create
reproducible and scalable data analyses. Workflows are described via
a human readable, Python based language. They can be seamlessly
scaled to server, cluster, grid and cloud environments, without the
need to modify the workflow definition. Finally, Snakemake workflows
can entail a description of required software, which will be
automatically deployed to any execution environment.

Snakemake is highly popular with, ~3 new citations per week.
Quick Example

Snakemake workflows are essentially Python scripts extended by
declarative code to define rules. Rules describe how to create output
files from input files.

rule targets:
    input:
        "plots/myplot.pdf"

rule transform:
    input:
        "raw/{dataset}.csv"
    output:
        "transformed/{dataset}.csv"
    singularity:
        "docker://somecontainer:v1.0"
    shell:
        "somecommand {input} {output}"

rule aggregate_and_plot:
    input:
        expand("transformed/{dataset}.csv", dataset=[1, 2])
    output:

https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08055
researchers from several physics and geology laboratories have developed Deep
Emulator Network SEarch (DENSE), a technique for using deep-learning to perform
scientific simulations from various fields, from high-energy physics to climate
science. Compared to previous simulators, the results from DENSE achieved
speedups ranging from 10 million to 2 billion times.

The scientists described their technique and several experiments in a paper
published on arXiv. Motivated by a need to efficiently generate neural network
emulators to replace slower simulations, the team developed a neural search
method and a novel super-architecture that generates convolutional neural
networks (CNNs); CNNs were chosen because they perform well on a large set of
"natural" signals that are the domain of many scientific models. Standard
simulator programs were used to generate training and test data for the CNNs,
and according to the team,

# Approximate Nearest Neighbour:
https://www.infoq.com/news/2019/05/bing-nns-algorithm-open-sourced/

Microsoft's latest contribution to open source, Space Partition Tree
And Graph (SPTAG), is an implementation of the approximate nearest
neighbor search (NNS) algorithm that is used in Microsoft Bing search
engine.

In sheer mathematical terms, SPTAG is able to efficiently find those
vectors in a given set that minimize the distance from a query
vector. In reality, SPTAG does an approximate NNS, meaning it takes a
guess at which vectors are the nearest neighbors, and does not
guarantee to return the actual nearest neighbors. This, in exchange,
improves the algorithms requirements in terms of memory and time
consumption.

# Sparse Transformers:
https://www.infoq.com/news/2019/05/openai-sparse-transformers/

Several common AI applications, such as image captioning or language
translation, can be modeled as sequence learning; that is, predicting
the next item in a sequence of data. Sequence-learning networks
typically consist of two sub-networks: an encoder and a decoder. Once
the two are trained, often the decoder can be used by itself to
generate completely new outputs; for example, artificial human speech
or fake Shakespeare.

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), specifically Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) networks, have been particularly effective in solving these
problems. In recent years, however, a simpler architecture called the
Transformer has gained popularity, since the Transformer reduced
training costs by an order of magnitude or more compared to other
architectures.

# Uber OOSS Plug-and-Play Lang.Model for Controlling AI-Generated Text
@[https://www.infoq.com/news/2019/12/uber-ai-language-model/]
Uber AI open-sourced their plug-and-play language model (PPLM) which can control
the topic and sentiment of AI-generated text. The model's output is evaluated
by human judges as achieving 36% better topic accuracy compared to the baseline GPT-2 model.

The team provided a full description of the system and experiments in a paper
published on arXiv. PPLM starts with a pre-trained  language model (LM), such as GPT-2.
These LMs can produce complex output which approaches human fluency, but it is difficult
to control the specific properties of the generated text. Instead of "fine-tuning" the LM
with additional training data, PPLM uses a separate attribute model that can evaluate the
LM's output for sentiment or topic; this model is used to control the text produced by the
LM. A strength parameter can tune how much the attribute model adjusts the LM output.
According to Uber's researchers,

# AI for AI: NN That Actually Work [[{NN,101,01_PM.TODO]]
@[https://www.wired.com/2016/05/facebook-trying-create-ai-can-create-ai/]

Finally, Neural Networks That Actually Work

"It's almost like being the coach rather than the player," says Demis
Hassabis, co-founder of DeepMind, the Google outfit behind the
history-making AI that beat the world's best Go player. "You're
coaxing these things, rather than directly telling them what to do."

That's why many of these companies are now trying to automate this
trial and error—or at least part of it. If you automate some of the
heavily lifting, the thinking goes, you can more rapidly push the
latest machine learning into the hands of rank-and-file
engineers—and you can give the top minds more time to focus on
bigger ideas and tougher problems. This, in turn, will accelerate the
progress of AI inside the Internet apps and services that you and I
use every day.

In other words, for computers to get smarter faster, computers
themselves must handle even more of the grunt work. The giants of the
Internet are building computing systems that can test countless
machine learning algorithms on behalf of their engineers, that can
cycle through so many possibilities on their own. Better yet, these
companies are building AI algorithms that can help build AI
algorithms. No joke. Inside Facebook, engineers have designed what
they like to call an "automated machine learning engineer," an
artificially intelligent system that helps create artificially
intelligent systems. It's a long way from perfection. But the goal is
to create new AI models using as little human grunt work as possible.
Feeling the Flow

After Facebook's $104 billion IPO in 2012, Hussein Mehanna and other
engineers on the Facebook ads team felt an added pressure to improve
the company's ad targeting, to more precisely match ads to the
hundreds of millions of people using its social network. This meant
building deep neural networks and other machine learning algorithms
that could make better use of the vast amounts of data Facebook
collects on the characteristics and behavior of those hundreds of
millions of people.

    'The more ideas you try, the better. The more data you try, the
better.'

According to Mehanna, Facebook engineers had no problem generating
ideas for new AI, but testing these ideas was another matter. So he
and his team built a tool called Flow. "We wanted to build a
machine-learning assembly line that all engineers at Facebook could
use," Mehanna says. Flow is designed to help engineers build, test,
and execute machine learning algorithms on a massive scale, and this
includes practically any form of machine learning—a broad
technology that covers all services capable of learning tasks largely
on their own.

Basically, engineers could readily test an endless stream of ideas
across the company's sprawling network of computer data centers. They
could run all sorts of algorithmic possibilities—involving not just
deep learning but other forms of AI, including logistic regression to
boosted decision trees—and the results could feed still more ideas.
"The more ideas you try, the better," Mehanna says. "The more data
you try, the better." It also meant that engineers could readily
reuse algorithms that others had built, tweaking these algorithms and
applying them to other tasks.

Soon, Mehanna and his team expanded Flow for use across the entire
company. Inside other teams, it could help generate algorithms that
could choose the links for your Faceboook News Feed, recognize faces
in photos posted to the social network, or generate audio captions
for photos so that the blind can understand what's in them. It could
even help the company determine what parts of the world still need
access to the Internet.

With Flow, Mehanna says, Facebook trains and tests about 300,000
machine learning models each month. Whereas it once rolled a new AI
model onto its social network every 60 days or so, it can now release
several new models each week.
The Next Frontier

The idea is far bigger than Facebook. It's common practice across the
world of deep learning. Last year, Twitter acquired a startup,
WhetLab, that specializes in this kind of thing, and recently,
Microsoft described how its researchers use a system to test a sea of
possible AI models. Microsoft researcher Jian Sun calls it
"human-assisted search."

    Engineers even built their own 'automated machine learning
engineer.'

Mehanna and Facebook want to accelerate this. The company plans to
eventually open source Flow, sharing it with the world at large, and
according to Mehanna, outfits like LinkedIn, Uber, and Twitter are
already interested in using it. Mehanna and team have also built a
tool called AutoML that can remove even more of the burden from human
engineers. Running atop Flow, AutoML can automatically "clean" the
data needed to train neural networks and other machine learning
algorithms—prepare it for testing without any human
intervention—and Mehanna envisions a version that could even gather
the data on its own. But more intriguingly, AutoML uses artificial
intelligence to help build artificial intelligence.

As Mehana says, Facebook trains and tests about 300,000 machine
learning models each month. AutoML can then use the results of these
tests to train another machine learning model that can optimize the
training of machine learning models. Yes, that can be a hard thing to
wrap your head around. Mehanna compares it to Inception. But it
works. The system can automatically chooses algorithms and parameters
that are likely to work. "It can almost predict the result before the
training," Mehanna says.

Inside the Facebook ads team, engineers even built that automated
machine learning engineer, and this too has spread to the rest of the
company. It's called Asimo, and according to Facebook, there are
cases where it can automatically generate enhanced and improved
incarnations of existing models—models that human engineers can
then instantly deploy to the net. "It cannot yet invent a new AI
algorithm," Mehanna says. "But who knows, down the road..."

It's an intriguing idea—indeed, one that has captivated science
fiction writers for decades: an intelligent machine that builds
itself. No, Asimo isn't quite as advanced—or as frightening—as
Skynet. But it's a step toward a world where so many others, not just
the field's sharpest minds, will build new AI. Some of those others
won't even be human.

# NLP geometry of linguistics by Dr. Ahmad Al-Yasry [[{NLP,geometry,deeplearning,neuralnetworks]]
  Doctor of Mathematics from Max Planck institute for Mathematics,
  Algorithm Designer, Machine Learning, Data Scientist
The geometry of linguistics, also known as computational geometry of
language, is a field that studies the relationship between language
and geometry. This field has several applications in machine learning
(ML) and artificial intelligence (AI).One of the main applications of
the geometry of linguistics in ML and AI is in natural language
processing (NLP). NLP involves the development of algorithms and
models that enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate
human language. The geometry of linguistics provides a framework for
representing language in a geometric space, which enables the use of
geometric algorithms and techniques in NLP tasks.For example, one
application of the geometry of linguistics in NLP is in the
development of word embeddings. Word embeddings are vector
representations of words in a high-dimensional space that capture
their semantic and syntactic properties. These embeddings are used in
various NLP tasks, such as language modeling, sentiment analysis, and
machine translation. The geometry of linguistics provides a
mathematical framework for understanding the geometric properties of
word embeddings and how they relate to language semantics.Another
application of the geometry of linguistics in ML and AI is in the
development of deep learning models. Deep learning is a subfield of
ML that involves the development of neural networks with multiple
layers. These models are used in various AI applications, such as
image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language
processing. The geometry of linguistics provides insights into the
geometric properties of neural networks and how they affect their
performance.Topological data analysis (TDA) is another field that has
applications in ML and AI. TDA is a mathematical framework for
analyzing complex datasets using techniques from algebraic topology.
TDA has been applied in various ML and AI tasks, such as clustering,
dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection.There is a relation
between the geometry of linguistics and TDA. Both fields involve the
study of geometric and topological properties of data. For example,
the geometry of linguistics provides a geometric framework for
representing language data, while TDA provides a topological
framework for analyzing the structure of complex datasets. The
combination of these two fields can lead to new insights and
techniques for solving complex problems in ML and AI.

# Extract relationship from video transcripts [[{use_case.*,nlp]]
  https://medium.com/neo4j/creating-a-knowledge-graph-from-video-transcripts-with-gpt-4-52d7c7b9f32c 
  Creating a Knowledge Graph From Video Transcripts With ChatGPT
Tomaz Bratanic 18 - 22 minutes Use GPT-4 as a domain expert to help
you extract knowledge from a video transcript. Image by the author.A
couple of days ago, I got access to GPT-4.The first thing that came
to my mind was to test how well it performs as an information
extraction model, where the task is to extract relevant entities and
relationships from a given text.I have already played around with
GPT-3.5 a bit. The most important thing I noticed is that we don’t
want to use the GPT endpoint as an entity linking solution or have it
come up with any other external references like citations, as it
likes to hallucinate those types of information.However, a great
thing about GPT-3 or GPT-4 is that it performs well in various
domains. For example, we can use it to extract people, organizations,
or locations from a text.However, I feel that competing against
dedicated NLP models is not where the GPT models shine (although they
perform well). Instead, the strength of GPT models is in their
ability to generalize and be used in other domains where other
open-sourced models fail due to their limited training data.My friend
gave me a great idea to test the GPT-4 on extracting information from
a nature documentary. Photo by Jong Marshes on UnsplashI always liked
the deep sea documentary as the ecosystem and animals vastly differ
from terrestrial ones. Therefore, I decided to test GPT-4 information
extraction capabilities on an underwater documentary. Additionally, I
don’t know of any open-source NLP models trained to detect
relationships between sea plants and creatures. So, a deep sea
documentary makes for an excellent example of using a GPT-4 to
construct a knowledge graph.All the code is available on GitHub in
the form of a Jupyter Notebook.DatasetThe most accessible place to
find documentaries is YouTube. Although the GPT-4 is multi-modal
(supports video, audio, and text), the current version of the
endpoint only supports text inputs. Therefore, we will analyze a
video’s audio transcript, not the video itself.We will be analyzing
the transcript of the following documentary.First of all, I like the
topic of the documentary: “The Spectacular Underwater World of
Coral Reefs.”Secondly, extracting captions from a YouTube video is
effortless as we don’t have to use any audio2text models at all.
However, converting audio to text with all the available models on
HuggingFace or even OpenAI’s Whisper should not be a big
problem.Thirdly, this video has captions that are not auto-generated.
At first, I tried to extract information from auto-generated captions
on YouTube, but I learned that they might not be the best input. So
if you can, avoid using auto-generated YouTube captions.The captions
can be retrieved straightforwardly with the YouTube
Transcript/Subtitle library. All we have to do is to provide the
video id.from youtube_transcript_api import
YouTubeTranscriptApivideo_id = "nrI483C5Tro"
transcript = YouTubeTranscriptApi.get_transcript(video_id)
print(transcript[:5])The transcript has the following structure.[
 {
 "text":"water the liquid that oceans are made of",
 "start":5.46,
 "duration":4.38
 },
 {
 "text":"and it fills endless depths only few will venture\\xa0\\xa0",
 "start":12.24,
 "duration":4.92
 },
 {
 "text":"out into the endless open ocean\\xa0\nof this vast underwater world",
 "start":17.16,
 "duration":4.68
 }
]
The captions are split into chunks, which can be used as video
subtitles. Therefore, the start and duration information is provided
along with the text. You might also notice a couple of special
characters like \xa0 and \n .Even though GPT-4 endpoint support up to
8k tokens per request, more is needed to process the whole transcript
in a single request. Therefore, we need to split the transcript into
several parts.So, I decided to split the transcript into multiple
parts, where the end of the part is determined when there are five or
more seconds of no captions, announcing a brief pause in narration.
Using this approach, I aim to keep all connecting text together and
retain relevant information in a single section.I used the following
code to group the transcript into several sections.
sections = []
current_section = ""
start_time = None
previous_end = 0
pause_threshold = 5for line in transcript:
 if current_section and (line["start"] - previous_end > pause_threshold):

 end_time = line["start"]
 sections.append(
 {
 "text": current_section.strip(),
 "start_time": start_time,
 "end_time": end_time,
 }
 )
 current_section = ""
 start_time = None
 else:

 if not start_time:
 start_time = line["start"]
 clean_text = line["text"].replace("\n", " ").replace("\xa0", " ")
 current_section += " ".join(clean_text.split()) + " "

 previous_end = line["start"] + line["duration"]
if current_section:
 end_time = transcript[-1]["start"] + transcript[-1]["duration"]
 sections.append(
 {
 "text": current_section.strip().replace("\n", " ").replace("\xa0", " "),
 "start_time": start_time,
 "end_time": end_time,
 }
 )

sections = [p for p in sections if p["text"]]
To evaluate the results of the section grouping, I printed the following information.
print(f"Number of paragraphs: {len(sections)}")
print(f"Max characters per paragraph: {max([len(el['text']) for el in sections])}")

There are 77 sections, with the longest having 1267 characters in it.
We are far from the GPT-4 token limit, and I think the above approach
delivers a nice text granularity, at least in this
example.Information Extraction With GPT-4GPT-4 endpoint is optimized
for chat but works well for traditional completion tasks. As the
model is optimized for conversation, we can provide a system message,
which helps set the assistant’s behavior along with any previous
messages that can help keep the context of the dialogue. However, as
we are using the GPT-4 endpoint for a text completion task, we will
not provide any previous messages.I used the following prompt as the
system message.system = "You are an archeology and biology expert
helping us extract relevant information."However, I noticed that the
model behaved almost identically when I provided the system message
or not. Next, I developed the following prompt through some
iterations, which extracts relevant entities and relationships from a
given text.

prompt = """#This a transcript from a sea documentary.
#The task is to extract as many relevant entities to biology, chemistry, or archeology.
#The entities should include all animals, biological entities, locations.
#However, the entities should not include distances or time durations.
#Also, return the type of an entity using the Wikipedia class system and the sentiment of the mentioned entity,
#where the sentiment value ranges from -1 to 1, and -1 being very negative, 1 being very positive
#Additionally, extract all relevant relationships between identified entities.
#The relationships should follow the Wikipedia schema type.
#The output of a relationship should be in a form of a triple Head, Relationship, Tail, for example
#Peter, WORKS_AT, Hospital/n
# An example "St. Peter is located in Paris" should have an output with the following format
entity
St. Peter, person, 0.0
Paris, location, 0.0relationships
St.Peter, LOCATED_IN, Paris\n"""
The GPT-4 is prompted to extract relevant entities from a given text.
Additionally, I added some constraints that distances and time
durations should not be treated as entities. The extracted entities
should contain their name, type, and sentiment. As for the
relationships, they should be provided in the form of a triple. I
added some hints that the model should follow the Wikipedia schema
type, making the extracted relationship types more standardized. I
learned that it is always good to provide an example of the output.
Otherwise, the model might use different output formats at will.One
thing to note is that we might have instructed the model to provide
us with a nice JSON representation of extracted entities and
relationships. Nicely structured data might certainly be plus.
However, you are paying the price for nicely structured JSON objects
as the cost of the API is calculated per input and output token
count. Therefore, the JSON boilerplate comes with a price.Next, we
need to define the function that calls the GPT-4 endpoint and
processes the response.@retry(tries=3, delay=5)
def process_gpt4(text):
 paragraph = text completion = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
 model="gpt-4",

 temperature=0,
 messages=[
 {"role": "system", "content": system},
 {"role": "user", "content": prompt + paragraph},
 ],
 ) nlp_results = completion.choices[0].message.content if not "relationships" in nlp_results:
 raise Exception(
 "GPT-4 is not being nice and isn't returning results in correct format"
 )
 return parse_entities_and_relationships(nlp_results)Even though we
explicitly defined the output format in the prompt, the GPT-4 model
sometimes does its own thing and does not follow the rules. It
happened to me only twice out of a couple of hundred requests.
However, it is annoying when that happens, and all the downstream
dataflow doesn’t work as intended. Therefore, I added a simple
check of the response and added a retry decorator in case that
happens.Additionally, I only added the temperature parameter to make
the model behave as deterministic as possible. However, when I rerun
the transcript a couple of times, I got slightly different results.
It costs around $1.6 to process the transcript of the chosen video
with GPT-4.Graph Model and ImportWe will be using Neo4j to store the
results of the information extraction pipeline. I have used a free
Neo4j Sandbox instance for this project, but you can also use the
AuraDB Free or local Desktop environment.One thing is certain. No NLP
model is perfect. Therefore, we want all extracted entities and
relationships to point to the text where they were extracted, which
allows us to verify the validity of information if necessary. Graph
schema. Image by the author.Since we want to point the extracted
entities and relationships to the relevant text, we need to include
the sections along with the video in our graph. The section nodes
contain the text, start, and end time. Entities and relationships are
then connected to the section nodes. What might be counterintuitive
is that we represent extracted relationships as a node in our graph.
The reason is that Neo4j doesn’t allow to have relationships to
point to another relationship. However, we want to have a link
between extracted relationship and its source text. Therefore, we
need to model the extracted relationship as a separate node.The
Cypher statement for the graph import is the following:import_query =
"""
MERGE (v:Video {id:$videoId})
CREATE (v)-[:HAS_SECTION]->(p:Section)
SET p.startTime = toFloat($start),
 p.endTime = toFloat($end),
 p.text = $text
FOREACH (e in $entities |
 MERGE (entity:Entity {name: e[0]})
 ON CREATE SET entity.type = e[1]
 MERGE (p)-[:MENTIONS{sentiment:toFloat(e[2])}]->(entity))
WITH p
UNWIND $relationships AS relation
MERGE (source:Entity {name: relation[0]})
MERGE (target:Entity {name: relation[2]})
MERGE (source)-[:RELATIONSHIP]->(r:Relationship {type: relation[1]})-[:RELATIONSHIP]->(target)
MERGE (p)-[mr:MENTIONS_RELATIONSHIP]->(r)
"""

Finally, we can go ahead and process the whole transcript and import
the extracted information into Neo4j using the following code:with
driver.session() as session:
 for i, section in enumerate(sections):
 print(f"Processing {i} paragraph")
 text = section["text"]
 start = section["start_time"]
 end = section["end_time"]
 entities, relationships = process_gpt4(text)
 params = {
 "videoId": video_id,
 "start": start,
 "end": end,
 "text": text,
 "entities": entities,
 "relationships": relationships,
 }
 session.run(import_query, params)

You can open Neo4j Browser and validate the import by executing the
following Cypher statement.CALL apoc.meta.graph()The meta-graph
procedure should return the following graph visualization. Generated
graph schema. Image by the author.Entity Disambiguation With
GPT-4After inspecting the GPT-4 results, I have decided that
performing a simple entity disambiguation would be best. For example,
there are currently five different nodes for a Moray Eels:moray
eelMorayMoray EelmoraymoraysWe could lowercase all entities and use
various NLP techniques to identify which nodes refer to the same
entities. However, we can also use the GPT-4 endpoint to perform
entity disambiguation. I wrote the following prompt to perform entity
disambiguation.disambiguation_prompt = """
#Act as a entity disambiugation tool and tell me which values reference the same entity.
#For example if I give you
#
#Birds
#Bird
#Ant
#
#You return to me
#
#Birds, 1
#Bird, 1
#Ant, 2
#
#As the Bird and Birds values have the same integer assigned to them, it means that they reference the same entity.
#Now process the following values\n
"""

The idea is to assign the same integers to nodes that refer to the
same entity. Using this prompt, we are able to tag all nodes with
additional disambiguation properties.def disambiguate(entities):
 completion = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
 model="gpt-4",

 temperature=0,
 messages=[
 {"role": "user", "content": disambiguation_prompt + "\n".join(all_animals)},
 ],
 ) disambiguation_results = completion.choices[0].message.content
 return [row.split(", ") for row in disambiguation_results.split("\n")]all_animals = run_query("""
MATCH (e:Entity {type: 'animal'})
RETURN e.name AS animal
""")['animal'].to_list()disambiguation_params = disambiguate(all_animals)
run_query(
 """
UNWIND $data AS row
MATCH (e:Entity {name:row[0]})
SET e.disambiguation = row[1]
""",
 {"data": disambiguation_params},
)

Now that the disambiguation information is in the database, we can
use it to evaluate the results.MATCH (e:Entity {type:"animal"})
RETURN e.disambiguation AS i, collect(e.name) AS entities
ORDER BY size(entities) DESC
LIMIT 5ResultsWhile this disambiguation is not that complicated, it is still worth noting that we can achieve this without NLP knowledge or having to develop any hand-crafted rules.AnalysisIn the final step of this blog post, we will evaluate the results of the information extraction pipeline using the GPT-4 model.First, we will examine the type and count of extracted entities.MATCH (e:Entity)
RETURN e.type AS type, count(*) AS count
ORDER BY count DESC
LIMIT 5ResultsMost entities are animals, locations, and biological entities. However, we can notice that sometimes the model decides to use the whitespace and other times underscore for biological entities.Throughout my experiments with GPT endpoints, I have observed that the best approach is to be as specific as possible in what information and how you want it to be categorized. Therefore, it is good practice with GPT-4 to define the types of entities we want to extract, as the resulting types will be more consistent.Additionally, the model didn’t classify 33 entity types. The thing is that GPT-4 might come up with some types for these entities if asked. However, they only appear in the relationship extraction part of the results, where entity types are not requested. One workaround could be to ask for entity types in the relationship extraction part.Next, we will examine which animals are the most mentioned in the video.MATCH (e:Entity {type:"animal"})
RETURN e.name AS entity, e.type AS type,
 count{(e)<-[:MENTIONS]-()} AS mentions
ORDER BY mentions DESC
LIMIT 5ResultsThe most mentioned animals are moray eels, lionfish, and brittle stars. I am familiar only with eels, so watching the documentary to learn about other fishes might be a good idea.We can also evaluate which relationships or facts have been extracted regarding moray eels.MATCH (e:Entity {name:"morays"})-[:RELATIONSHIP]->(r)-[:RELATIONSHIP]->(target)
RETURN e.name AS source, r.type AS relationship, target.name AS target,
 count{(r)<-[:MENTIONS_RELATIONSHIP]-()} AS mentions
UNION ALL
MATCH (e:Entity {name:"morays"})<-[:RELATIONSHIP]->(r)<-[:RELATIONSHIP]-(source)
RETURN source.name AS source, r.type AS relationship, e.name AS target,
 count{(r)<-[:MENTIONS_RELATIONSHIP]-()} AS mentionsResultsThere is quite a lot we can learn about moray eels. They cooperate with groupers, coexist with Triggerfishes, and are being cleaned by cleaner shrimps. Additionally, a moray searching for a female moray can be relatable.Let’s say we want to check if the relationship that morays interact with lionfish is accurate. We can retrieve the source text and validate the claim manually.MATCH (e:Entity)-[:RELATIONSHIP]->(r)-[:RELATIONSHIP]->(t:Entity)
WHERE e.name = "morays" AND r.type = "INTERACTS_WITH" AND t.name = "Lionfish"
MATCH (r)<-[:MENTIONS_RELATIONSHIP]-(s:Section)
RETURN s.text AS textResultsly tough are its cousins the scorpion fishes they
lie there as if dead especially when others around
them freak out and even when moray eels fight with lionfishes for foodThe text mentions that eels fight with lionfish for food. We can also notice that the transcript is hard to read and understand, even for a human. Therefore, we can commend GPT-4 for doing a good job on a transcript where even a human might struggle.Lastly, we can use the knowledge graph as a search engine that returns timestamps of sections where relevant entities we want to see. So, for example, we can ask the database to return all the timestamps of sections in which lionfish is mentioned.MATCH (e:Entity {name:"Lionfish"})<-[:MENTIONS]-(s:Section)<-[:HAS_SECTION]-(v:Video)
RETURN s.startTime AS timestamp, s.endTime AS endTime,
 "https://youtube.com/watch?v=" + v.id + "&t=" + toString(toInteger(s.startTime)) AS URL
ORDER BY timestampResultsSummaryThe remarkable ability of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models to generalize across various domains is a powerful tool for exploring and analyzing different datasets to extract relevant information. Honestly, I’m not entirely sure which endpoint I would use to recreate this blog post without GPT-4. As far as I know, there are no open-source relation extraction models or datasets on sea creatures. Therefore, to avoid the hassle of labeling a dataset and training a custom model, we can simply utilize a GPT endpoint. Furthermore, I eagerly anticipate the opportunity to examine its promised capability for multi-modal analysis based on audio or text input.As always, the code is available on GitHub.

# transformers "vs" graph neural network [[{]]
Tony Seale 3rd Knowledge Graph Engineer at UBS It is widely
recognised that Large Language Models, such as GPT, are built on the
Transformer architecture. However, what may be less widely
acknowledged is that it is possible to view the Transformers
themselves as a type of Graph Neural Network. The value of this
insight is that it reveals an exciting new possibility: that is the
potential power to bridge the gap between structured and unstructured
data, opening the doors to the creation of far more powerful and
versatile models.Whilst text is often regarded as unstructured, in
fact, Transformers reveal the complex semantic structure that
underlies language. Fortunately, Graphs are not only adept at but
ideal for, handling this level of complexity. It, therefore, seems
logical to conclude, that by combining the two, we may actually be
able to break down the supposed barrier between structured and
unstructured data.Let’s consider how this might work. Transformers
analyse sentences by assigning importance to each word in relation to
others, helping them predict or generate the next words in a
sentence. This 'attention mechanism' evaluates pairwise interactions
between all tokens in a sequence, and these interactions can be seen
as edges in a complete graph. Thus, Transformers can be thought of as
graph-based models where tokens represent nodes and attention weights
represent edges.It is my opinion that the integration of Transformers
with Graph Neural Networks holds great potential for advancing the
field of machine learning. Vitally, in our organisations, the
perceived distinction between our text and our databases may no
longer need to exist, as full data integration becomes a potential
reality. Suddenly powerful AI within our own organisations does not
seem like such a distant prospect after all.If you're interested in
learning more about this exciting possibility, please check out the

# ¿Por qué hay que repensar ahora la IA?  [[{]]
No es catastrofismo, sino precaución Noemí G. Gómez 8 - 10 minutes
La explosión de los modelos de inteligencia artificial generativa,
capaces de "conversar" y crear textos, imágenes o música a partir
de datos existentes, ha hecho que más de 5.500 expertos de todo el
mundo hayan pedido una pausa, pero ¿por qué ahora? El ritmo al que
avanza esta tecnología preocupa, hay que repensarla.Encabezados por
Yoshua Bengio, premio Turing y profesor de la Universidad de
Montreal, en Canadá, y Stuart Russell, de la Universidad de
California en Berkeley, Estados Unidos, los expertos solicitan en una
carta a los laboratorios que suspendan al menos seis meses el
entrenamiento de sistemas de inteligencia artificial (IA) más
potentes que GPT-4 (el último modelo de IA generativa de la empresa
OpenAI).Entre los firmantes hay varios españoles. Carles Sierra,
director del Instituto de Investigación en Inteligencia Artificial
del Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas (CSIC), y Pablo
Jarillo-Herrero, del Instituto Tecnológico de Massachusetts (MIT),
quienes coinciden en que no se han tomado "las precauciones
necesarias" antes de trasladar masivamente esta IA a la
ciudadanía.Sierra, en declaraciones a EFE, admite tener "una
preocupación creciente por esta especie de carrera armamentística"
en la que están las empresas tecnológicas. No solo es OpenIA la que
está desarrollando modelos de IA generativa, también Google, con
Bard, o Meta con LLaMa.No se trata de catastrofismoNo se trata de
catastrofismo, dice Sierra, sino que "hay compañías que han
invertido mucho dinero, quieren monetizar lo que han hecho y están
en la batalla por ver quién se lleva el trozo más grande del
pastel", pero en "este proceso están siendo poco prudentes".Falta
evaluación y sin ella no sabemos qué consecuencias puede tener esta
IA, afirma el experto del CSIC, quien lo compara con el proceso de
investigación y aprobación de un medicamento; las agencias
reguladoras tardan años en aprobarlos y solo tras la superación de
las tres fases de los ensayos clínicos (hay una cuarta de
farmacovigilancia)."Las empresas están sucediendo sus versiones a un
ritmo de una cada mes -OpenIA ya trabaja en ChatGPT-5-, poniendo a
disposición de todo el mundo los nuevos modelos, y no de manera
sectorial", lamenta.Jarillo-Herrero también está preocupado por el
ritmo al que está avanzando esta IA y recuerda que hace algún
tiempo también hubo interés en una moratoria sobre el uso de la
técnica de edición genética Crispr, que progresaba "mucho más
deprisa de lo que la humanidad podía 'digerir', y algunas
aplicaciones se podían ir de las manos"."Con tecnologías tan
disruptivas es conveniente entender y anticipar las posibles
consecuencias de su uso y regularlo", señala a EFE.Ambos expertos
coinciden en que la IA, también la generativa, puede proporcionar
beneficios, pero, tal y como advierte Sierra, estos sistemas buscan
que el resultado sea verosímil, no necesariamente cierto, y que
parezca que lo ha dicho un humano; ahí está el riesgo.Basados en el
aprendizaje automático, estos sistemas, de los que también preocupa
la privacidad y el uso de datos personales, aprenden de los millones
de textos, imágenes o vídeos publicados en internet, y los
desarrolladores se quedan con los datos de las miles de
"conversaciones" de los usuarios para mejorar los siguientes
modelos.El mayor temor, la desinformaciónJarillo-Herrero, profesor
de Física en el MIT, concentra sus preocupaciones sobre todo en la
desinformación. Imágenes hiperrealistas del papa Francisco con un
plumas blanco o de Donald Trump resistiéndose a un arresto son dos
de los ejemplos que han circulado estos días en redes."Antes ya
había mucha desinformación, pero era bastante fácil darse cuenta y
distinguir para una persona educada. Ahora, con el uso de la IA, es
mucho más fácil publicar/diseminar información que en una primera
lectura parece real pero que en realidad es falsa", resume
Jarillo-Herrero.Además, "la información/texto con el que se entrena
esta IA contiene muchos 'biases' -sesgos-, los mismos que los
humanos", con lo cual las respuestas generadas contienen todo tipo de
estereotipos falsos.El investigador reflexiona que la humanidad, en
general, nunca ha sido muy efectiva en contener avances científicos
y técnicos no deseados, por ejemplo, bastantes países han
desarrollado bombas atómicas o nucleares."Sin embargo hay una gran
diferencia entre la IA y otros avances peligrosos como las bombas
nucleares. Para estas últimas se requiere una instrumentación y
materiales muy complejos, no fácilmente disponibles incluso para
gobiernos".En cambio, apunta, cualquiera con unos cuantos ordenadores
puede hacer uso de la IA. "Por ejemplo, los piratas informáticos
deben estar planeando ya miles de ataques utilizando IA, que puede
resolver fácilmente puzles de verificación que antes requerían un
humano"."Esta moratoria de seis meses, si se produce, quizás ayude a
los gobiernos a intentar entender mejor las posibles consecuencias
negativas de la IA y a regularizar su uso. Las compañías más
avanzadas pueden quizás pausar y pensar en cómo contrarrestar esos
efectos negativos", concluye el científico del MIT.Sierra, quien
alerta del peligro de poner en manos de un adolescente un sistema que
puede generar desinformación, también habla de regular su uso y
recuerda que la soberanía siempre está en el pueblo: "no estoy de
acuerdo en prohibir, pero sí en regular".Código deontológicoEste
experto, también presidente de la Asociación Europea de IA, apuesta
por redactar un código deontológico claro. Hay antecedentes de
documentos de buenas prácticas de la Unión Europea, de la OCDE o de
sociedades e instituciones estadounidenses y británicas, pero ahora
es necesario un código mundial, robusto y transparente.En este
sentido, explica estar en contacto con Stuart Russell, uno de los
promotores de la carta, para estudiar cómo vehiculizarlo.A nivel
europeo, dice, habría que llevar la ley de inteligencia artificial
de nuevo a la mesa de discusión, para especificar los riesgos de la
IA generativa y cómo poner límites.La ley, cuya aplicación se
prevé este año, incluye la prohibición de prácticas como el
reconocimiento facial en espacios abiertos y clasifica los riesgos de
la IA en alto, moderado o de poco riesgo.Identifica por tanto
sectores, como el educativo, en el que hay que tener especial
salvaguarda y control (el uso de IA para evaluar alumnos o asignarlos
en las escuelas lo califica de alto riesgo).Sin embargo, cuando se
redactó la ley los sistemas de IA generativa estaban aún
desarrollándose. Ahora que los hay muy avanzados, habría que volver
atrás y adaptar la norma, concluye Sierra.

Quadruple Kaggle Grandmaster5hPandas 2.0 is here! This is the biggest
overhaul of Pandas since its inception, and it has been years in the
making. However, you will probably not notice too many changes, and
all your existing Pandas code will most likely run the same as
before. All the major changes are under the hood. That's because
Pandas has moved away from the way it represents data, from numpy to
Apache Arrow. Pandas was originally built on top of numpy, and it was
an adequate solution for many tasks. However, three are many
limitations of numpy that have only become more obvious over the
years. Apache Arrow will significantly help with those pain points,
and will speed up many Pandas tasks. I've only played with the new
version for a day so far. My limited impression is that it
significantly speeds up loading and saving of csv files, and puts the
new version of Pandas on par with Polars in that regard. Lookign
forward to playing more with it in the weeks and months ahead.Great

KMeans is a popular but high-run-time clustering algorithm. Here's
how a small tweak can significantly improve its run time.KMeans
selects the initial centroids randomly. As a result, it fails to
converge at times. Thus, one has to repeat clustering several times
with different initialization and select the best model.Instead,
KMeans++ takes a smarter approach to initialize centroids. The first
centroid is selected randomly. But the next centroid is chosen based
on the distance from the first centroid.

# Pandas 101  [[{]]
From time to time, we are advised to avoid iterating on a Pandas
DataFrame. Here's the core reason behind this.A DataFrame is a
column-major data structure. Thus, consecutive elements in a column
are stored next to each other in memory.As processors are efficient
with contiguous blocks of memory, retrieving a column is much faster
than a row.But while iterating, as each row is retrieved by accessing
non-contiguous blocks of memory, the run-time increases
drastically.In the image below, retrieving over 32M elements of a
column was still over 20x faster than fetching just nine elements
stored in a row. Check out my daily newsletter to learn something new

# When reinforcement learning and structured Gaussian Processes meet [[{]]
  Sergei Kalinin3rdAmazon, special projects. University of Tennessee,
Knoxville, machine learning in physical sciences 4. : hypothesis
learningOver the last 2 years, AI4Science is rapidly gaining
prominence across multiple communities. The concept per se is very
appealing - we have powerful ML algorithms for advanced data
analysis, emerging automated labs and microscopes, so certainly we
can put them together and make automated scientists!However, what
does it mean to do science? Science is not simply analyzing data.
Ultimately, science is the feedback cycle between theory and
experiment that allows to go where no one has gone before and learn
what happens there. The role of theory is to analyze existing data
and make hypothesis about what may be happening in the parts of the
parameter space we did not explore. The role of experiment is to
actually go there, collect new data, use it to falsify the
hypothesis, and also discover serendipitous behaviors and phenomena.
Over time, we also develop better tools for doing experiment, but
this is slower. The reason we need hypotheses is because we cannot
explore *all* possible eventualities - our experimental budgets are
usually limited. Which means that we need to formulate the questions
in such a way that they can be answered in a small number of
attempts. Maxim Ziatdinov and I have started to think about these
concepts 2 years ago when playing with the reinforcement learning
(RL) and observing Mario making large number of random attempts when
learning to navigate the perils of the Mushroom Kingdom. Surely the
progress would have been much faster if Mario have asked some basic
questions - should I step on suspicious moving brown mushrooms with
eyes? Should I pick the gold coin? Rather then randomly attempting
moving and jumping, it would be far more efficient to define possible
models of behavior with respect to specific objects. Making
hypotheses for outcomes and falsifying them would make learning much
faster!Much like for Mario, classical data driven reinforcement
learning is very limited for experiment - it is too data intensive.
We cannot try everything. However, in physical sciences we often have
hypotheses!The hypothesis learning is a combination of the basic
reward concept from RL and Bayesian probabilistic learning. We assume
that the *right* model of system behavior allows to learn faster -
the behavior you have seen in the previous notebooks comparing GP and
sGP. To recognize it, we introduce reward to the model that learns
faster. To make sure that we do not get trapped into local minimum,
we add epsilon-greedy policy to explore all models.If you are
interested in the real-world examples, have a look at our recent work

 In many ML problems we usually need
to handle high dimensional data. In classic ML applications it happen
a lot, but with unstructured data (vision, nlp) this is almost always
the case. Visualization of high-dimensional data is hard. When
needed, #datascientist usually use dimensionality reduction
techniques (e.g. PCA/SVD) that loses some information of the data.
Today I discovered HiPlot - a #python package that enables
interactive visualizations to help #datascientist discover

# Meet RLPrompt: A New Prompt Optimization Approach with Reinforcement Learning (RL) [[{]]
By Niharika Singh
March 1, 2023
Source: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.12548.pdf

Prompting is a promising approach to solving NLP problems with
pre-trained language models (LMs) such as GPTs and BERT. Unlike
conventional fine-tuning that updates the massive LM parameters for
each downstream task, prompting concatenates inputs with additional
text to steer the LM towards producing the desired outputs. A key
question is finding optimal prompts to improve the LM’s performance
on various tasks with few training examples.Reinforcement Learning
(RL) for prompt optimization challenges learning efficiency as the
large black-box language model navigates a complex environment
involving multiple transitions before computing rewards. This
complexity makes it challenging to learn from the unstable reward
signals. However, to overcome this, we propose two simple but
effective strategies. Firstly, normalizing the training signal by
computing the z-score of rewards for the same input can stabilize the
reward signals. Secondly, designing piecewise reward functions that
offer sparse, qualitative bonuses for desirable behaviors, such as
achieving a certain accuracy on a specific class, can improve
optimization efficiency.Existing work relies on soft prompt tuning
that needs more interpretability, reusability, and applicability in
the absence of gradients. Discrete prompt optimization is complex,
and heuristics such as paraphrasing and selection must be more
systematic. In the latest research paper, researchers from CMU and
UCSD propose RLPrompt, an efficient discrete prompt optimization
approach using reinforcement learning (RL) applicable to different
LMs for classification and generation tasks. Be a part of the fastest
growing AI subreddit community with 15k membersExperiments show
superior performance over finetuning or prompting methods for
few-shot classification and unsupervised text style transfer.
Interestingly, optimized prompts often consist of ungrammatical
gibberish text, which shows LMs may have understood common frameworks
for prompting, but they do not adhere to human language
norms.What’s newThis paper introduces RLPrompt, a new approach to
prompt optimization that utilizes reinforcement learning (RL). This
method combines desirable properties for optimizing prompts across
different tasks and language models.Instead of editing the discrete
tokens directly, which has proven difficult and inefficient, RLPrompt
employs a policy network that generates the desired prompts. Learning
a small number of policy parameters enables discrete prompt
optimization by inserting them as an MLP layer into a frozen compact
model like distilGPT-2.This formulation also enables off-the-shelf RL
algorithms (such as soft Q-learning) that learn the policy with
arbitrary reward functions. These reward functions can be defined
with available data, such as in few-shot classification, or with
other weak signals when supervised data is not accessible, like in
controllable text generation.The study found that strongly optimized
prompts are less coherent but transferable between language models,
resulting in a remarkable performance. This observation opens up new
and promising possibilities for prompting, such as learning cheap
prompts from smaller models and performing inferences with larger
ones.However, the limitations and potential drawbacks of RLPrompt are
yet to be explored, and it is uncertain whether it is a suitable
method for all types of applications. Further research is needed to
fully understand the strengths and weaknesses of RLPrompt.Check out

Most machine learning models let you tweak their parameters to
achieve optimal performance, a technique known as hyperparameter
tuning. The scikit-learn library supports various hyperparameter
tuning methods, such as grid search and randomized search.
Unfortunately, those techniques can become time consuming as they
aren't optimized. In contrast, the scikit-optimize library uses
bayesian optimization to model the hyperparameter search space, thus
finding the optimal combination as soon as possible. You can check

think Microsoft partnering with OpenAI might have been one of the
most successful publicity stunts ever! The current public perception
is that nothing can compete with ChatGPT in terms of generative AI
for text. But do you remember when Blake Lemoine was fired by Google
back in 2022 when he leaked information about the LaMDA model because
he thought it was sentient? Google has nothing to fear when it comes
to relevance in the area of text generation research, but Bing may
now take a larger market share in the search engine space thanks to
the clever OpenAI marketing and the way Microsoft capitalized on that
perception.Here are a few direct competitors of ChatGPT, and today is
Monday, so there will be a couple more by the end of the weekend:-
PEER by Meta AI - a language trained to imitate the writing process.
It is trained on Wikipedia's edit history data
(https://lnkd.in/gM7Gf_iE). It specializes in predicting edits and
explaining the reasons for those edits. It is capable of citing and
quoting reference documents to back up the claims it generates. It is
a 11 B parameters Transformers with the typical encoder-decoder
architecture, and it is outperforming GPT-3 on the task it
specializes in: https://lnkd.in/gkwKmNiN.- LaMDA by Google AI - a
language model trained for dialog applications. It is pre-trained on
~3 B documents and ~1 B dialogs and fine-tuned on human generated
data to improve on quality, safety and truthfulness of the generated
text. It is also fine-tuned to learn to call an external information
retrieval system such as Google Search, a calculator, and a
translator making it potentially a much stronger candidate to replace
Google Search than ChatGPT. It a 135B parameters decoder only
transformer: https://lnkd.in/gmTQHKtz- PaLM by Google AI - The
biggest of all: 540 B parameters! Breakthrough capabilities in
arithmetic and common-sense reasoning. It is trained on 780 billion
tokens coming from multilingual social media conversations, filtered
multilingual webpages, books, GitHub repo, multilingual Wikipedia and
news. https://lnkd.in/gakVMSwBThe more I read about those Large
Language Models, the more I feel that very little has changed since
2017's "Attention is all you need": https://lnkd.in/gUts7Sjq! All
those models follow the exact same architecture with a couple of
changes here and there. The advancements are mostly happening in the
scale of the data and the models and the domain specificity of the
data. At those scales, the fun is a lot about how to minimize
training costs. I wonder, if I were to train a HUGE XGBoost model
with my own HUGE dataset, would I be able to name that model
DamienBoost and publish a paper about it?

  10 Top graph Neural Networks and Python Lib to Make it Happen
 https://www.linkedin.com/posts/maryammiradi_machinelearning-artificialintelligence-ai-activity-7021810138831314945-YOoM

Neural Networks:GNN is a type of Neural Network operating on Graph structure providing an easy way
to do node-level, edge-level, and graph-level prediction tasks for
many applications such as Medical Diagnosis, Drug discovery, Social
influence prediction, Traffic forecasting, Link Prediction, Text
Classification and many more.

Top 10   Python libs:
Graph LSTM:Instead of GRU, we can apply
LSTM instead. As shown below, the are different variants of Graph
LSTM with slightly different equations. Deep Graph Library (DGL)
Graph Autoencoders (GAEs):It encodes a graph into a latent feature
space and reconstructs the graph from it. GAE is trained to minimize
the reconstruction loss between the real adjacency matrix and the
decoded adjacency matrix of the decoder. PyTorch Geometric Structural
Deep Network Embedding (SDNE): SDNE exploits proximity to preserve
the network structure (pairwise similarity between nodes connected by
edges). SDNE Variational Graph Auto-EncodersA better version of SDNE
because encode both node structural information and node feature
information. PyTorch Geometric Spatial-temporal graph neural networks
(STGNNs):It analyze spatial-temporal graphs that utilize both spatial
and temporal information to make predictions. Node representation
depends on neighboring nodes in the spatial and temporal directions.
Deep Graph Library (DGL) Graph convolutional recurrent network
(GCRN):similar to LSTM it applies graph convolution to the spatial
and temporal data. Deep Graph Library (DGL) Diffusion convolutional
recurrent neural network (DCRNN): it utilizes the encoder-decoder
architecture and the GRU to capture the spatial and temporal
information of a graph. StellarGraph Convolutional Graph Neural
Network (CON-GNN):It operates on adjacency matrix and nodes’ input
features at time t to capture the spatial dependency. Deep Graph
Library (DGL) Graph Attention Networks (GATs):GATs uses attention
mechanisms to weight the importance of the different nodes in a graph
when computing node representations. This allows them to focus on the
most important parts of the graph and ignore less relevant parts.
PyTorch Geometric GraphSAGE:GraphSAGE is a graph neural network
architecture that uses a combination of graph convolutional layers
and graph-pooling layers to learn node representations. StellarGraph
And another 3 extra libraries: NetworkX Spektral PyTorch-BigGraph
(PBG)

# Ml: causal programming [[{causalinference]]
  Here are 4 Python causality libraries to learn in 2023.Python
causal ecosystem grows rapidly. While writing my book
(https://causalpython.io) I analyzed it thoroughly, looking for
packages that have stable support, enthusiastic contributors and
simply do their job. Here are my four recommendations:
𝗗𝗼𝗪𝗵𝘆 (https://lnkd.in/dcZ_YkzV)This package
originally from Microsoft Research has now moved to an independent
project. Provides a unified interface for causal inference using
structural causal models, graphical models, and more. It has a
user-friendly API and can handle both observational and experimental
data. Very comprehensive! A great candidate for the Sci-kit Learn of
Causality!Learn DoWhy - check the blog post!
(https://lnkd.in/d3x9t5Yv) 𝗘𝗰𝗼𝗻𝗠𝗟
(https://lnkd.in/dumHpNx8)DoWhy’s sister package built with
conditional treatment effect estimation in mind. Supported by
Microsoft. Integrates smoothly with DoWhy’s casual flow, whichj is
a great advantage! The greatest competitor of another amazing package
- Uber’s CausalML 𝗴𝗖𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗹𝗲
(https://lnkd.in/ezRq5QkS)A causal discovery super-hero! Supported by
Huawei, it’s the only package out there that implements the most
recent causal discovery and causal structure learning methods,
including gradient-based and reinforcement-learning-based stuff!
Great for benchmarking. Want to learn more? - Check the blog post!
(https://lnkd.in/duqJmBaZ) 𝗖𝗮𝘂𝘀𝗮𝗹𝗣𝘆
(https://lnkd.in/dVQu93PH)A new kid on the block released less than
two months ago. CausalPy is based on PyMC Labs' PyMC - a
well-established probabilistic programming framework in Python.
CausalPy has been developed by PyMC’s prolific Dr Benjamin Vincent
with contributions from Wolt’s excellent data scientist Juan Camilo
Orduz. CausalPy implements a bunch of methods to work with
quasi-experimental data. Everything in Bayesian fashion! Watch out as
it’s still in beta (!) yet a great candidate for the best new
causal package of 2023!Happy learning & productive 2023! The code

# RIP correlation. [[{]]
101
https://towardsdatascience.com/rip-correlation-introducing-the-predictive-power-score-3d90808b9598 
 Introducing the Predictive Power ScoreWe define and open-source the
Predictive Power Score (PPS). The PPS is an alternative to the
correlation that finds more patterns in your data.Too many problems
with the correlationIt is Friday afternoon and your boss tells you
that the data delivery surprisingly arrived early — after only 4
weeks of back and forth. This was the missing piece for your
predictive model. You’re excited but also a little bit anxious
because you know what’s next: exploring the data. All. 45. Columns.
This will take many hours but you know it’s worth it because
without data understanding you are walking blind. One obvious step is
to have a look at all the univariate column distributions. But this
won’t be enough.You ask yourself: what relationships exist between
columns?To answer this question, you just repeat the typical drill:
calculate a correlation matrix and check for some surprising
relationships. Whenever you are surprised, you take a moment to plot
a scatterplot of the two columns at hand and see if you can make any
sense of it. Hopefully you can but too often you cannot because you
don’t even know what the columns mean in the first place. But this
is a story for another day.After inspecting the correlation matrix
you move on and you don’t even know what you don’t know
(scary).Let’s take a moment to review the correlation. The score
ranges from -1 to 1 and indicates if there is a strong linear
relationship — either in a positive or negative direction. So far
so good. However, there are many non-linear relationships that the
score simply won’t detect. For example, a sinus wave, a quadratic
curve or a mysterious step function. The score will just be 0,
saying: “Nothing interesting here”. Also, correlation is only
defined for numeric columns. So, let’s drop all the categoric
columns. In my last project more than 60% of the columns were
categoric, but hey. Never mind. And no, I won’t convert the columns
because they are not ordinal and OneHotEncoding will create a matrix
that has more values than there are atoms in the universe. Too many
scenarios where the correlation is 0. This makes me wonder if I
missed something… (Excerpt from the image by Denis Boigelot)If you
are a little bit too well educated you know that the correlation
matrix is symmetric. So you basically can throw away one half of it.
Great, we saved ourselves some work there! Or did we? Symmetry means
that the correlation is the same whether you calculate the
correlation of A and B or the correlation of B and A. However,
relationships in the real world are rarely symmetric. More often,
relationships are asymmetric. Here is an example: The last time I
checked, my zip code of 60327 tells strangers quite reliably that I
am living in Frankfurt, Germany. But when I only tell them my city,
somehow they are never able to deduce the correct zip code. Pff …
amateurs. Another example is this: a column with 3 unique values will
never be able to perfectly predict another column with 100 unique
values. But the opposite might be true. Clearly, asymmetry is
important because it is so common in the real world.Thinking about
those shortcomings of correlation, I started to wonder: can we do
better?The requirements: One day last year, I was dreaming about a
score that would tell me if there is any relationship between two
columns — no matter if the relationship is linear, non-linear,
gaussian or only known by aliens. Of course, the score should be
asymmetric because I want to detect all the weird relationships
between cities and zip codes. The score should be 0 if there is no
relationship and the score should be 1 if there is a perfect
relationship. And as the icing on the cake, the score should be able
to handle categoric and numeric columns out of the box. Summing it up
for all my academic friends: an asymmetric, data-type-agnostic score
for predictive relationships between two columns that ranges from 0
to 1.Calculating the Predictive Power Score (PPS)First of all, there
is not the one and only way to calculate the predictive power score.
In fact, there are many possible ways to calculate a score that
satisfies the requirements mentioned before. So, let’s rather think
of the predictive power score as a framework for a family of
scores.Let’s say we have two columns and want to calculate the
predictive power score of A predicting B. In this case, we treat B as
our target variable and A as our (only) feature. We can now calculate
a cross-validated Decision Tree and calculate a suitable evaluation
metric. When the target is numeric we can use a Decision Tree
Regressor and calculate the Mean Absolute Error (MAE). When the
target is categoric, we can use a Decision Tree Classifier and
calculate the weighted F1. You might also use other scores like the
ROC etc but let’s put those doubts aside for a second because we
have another problem:Most evaluation metrics are meaningless if you
don’t compare them to a baselineI guess you all know the situation:
you tell your grandma that your new model has a F1 score of 0.9 and
somehow she is not as excited as you are. In fact, this is very smart
of her because she does not know if anyone can score 0.9 or if you
are the first human being who ever scored higher than 0.5 after
millions of awesome KAGGLErs tried. So, we need to “normalize”
our evaluation score. And how do you normalize a score? You define a
lower and an upper limit and put the score into perspective. So what
should the lower and upper limit be? Let’s start with the upper
limit because this is usually easier: a perfect F1 is 1. A perfect
MAE is 0. Boom! Done. But what about the lower limit? Actually, we
cannot answer this in absolute terms.The lower limit depends on the
evaluation metric and your data set. It is the value that a naive
predictor achieves.If you achieve a F1 score of 0.9 this might be
super bad or really good. If your super fancy cancer detection model
always predicts “benign” and it still scores 0.9 on that highly
skewed dataset then 0.9 is obviously not so good. So, we need to
calculate a score for a very naive model. But what is a naive model?
For a classification problem, always predicting the most common class
is pretty naive. For a regression problem, always predicting the
median value is pretty naive. Example 2: Comparing the Pearson
correlation matrix (left) with the PPS matrix (right) for the Titanic
dataset.Two findings about the correlation matrix:The correlation
matrix is smaller and leaves out many interesting relationships. Of
course, that makes sense because columns like Sex, TicketID or Port
are categoric and the correlation cannot be computed for them.The
correlation matrix shows a negative correlation between TicketPrice
and Class of medium strength (-0.55). We can double-check this
relationship if we have a look at the PPS. We will see that the
TicketPrice is a strong predictor for the Class (0.9 PPS) but not
vice versa. The Class only predicts the TicketPrice with a PPS of
0.2. This makes sense because whether your ticket did cost 5.000$ or
10.000$ you were most likely in the highest class. In contrast, if
you know that someone was in the highest class you cannot say whether
they paid 5.000$ or 10.000$ for their ticket. In this scenario, the
asymmetry of the PPS shines again.Four findings about the PPS
matrix:The first row of the matrix tells you that the best univariate
predictor of the column Survived is the column Sex. This makes sense
because women were prioritized during the rescue. (We could not find
this information in the correlation matrix because the column Sex was
dropped.)If you have a look at the column for TicketID, you can see
that TicketID is a fairly good predictor for a range of columns. If
you further dig into this pattern, you will find out that multiple
persons had the same TicketID. Thus, the TicketID is actually
referencing a latent group of passengers who bought the ticket
together, for example the big Italian Rossi family that turns any
evening into a spectacle. Thus, the PPS helped me to detect a hidden
pattern.What’s even more surprising than the strong predictive
power of TicketID is the strong predictive power of TicketPrice
across a wide range of columns. Especially, the fact that the
TicketPrice is fairly good at predicting the TicketID (0.67) and vice
versa (0.64). Upon further research you will find out that tickets
often had unique prices. For example, only the Italian Rossi family
paid a price of 72,50$. This is a critical insight! It means that the
TicketPrice contains information about the TicketID and thus about
our Italian family. An information that you need to have when
considering potential information leakage.Looking at the PPS matrix,
we can see effects that might be explained by causal chains. (Did he
just say causal? — Of course, those causal hypotheses have to be
treated carefully but this is beyond the scope of this article.) For
example, you might be surprised why the TicketPrice has predictive
power on the survival rate (PPS 0.39). But if you know that the Class
influences your survival rate (PPS 0.36) and that the TicketPrice is
a good predictor for your Class (PPS 0.9), then you might have found
an explanation.
.Applications of the PPS and the PPS matrixAfter we learned about the
advantages of the PPS, let’s see where we can use the PPS in the
real life.Disclaimer: There are use cases for both the PPS and the
correlation. The PPS clearly has some advantages over correlation for
finding predictive patterns in the data. However, once the patterns
are found, the correlation is still a great way of communicating
found linear relationships.Find patterns in the data: The PPS finds
every relationship that the correlation finds — and more. Thus, you
can use the PPS matrix as an alternative to the correlation matrix to
detect and understand linear or nonlinear patterns in your data. This
is possible across data types using a single score that always ranges
from 0 to 1.Feature selection: In addition to your usual feature
selection mechanism, you can use the predictive power score to find
good predictors for your target column. Also, you can eliminate
features that just add random noise. Those features sometimes still
score high in feature importance metrics. In addition, you can
eliminate features that can be predicted by other features because
they don’t add new information. Besides, you can identify pairs of
mutually predictive features in the PPS matrix — this includes
strongly correlated features but will also detect non-linear
relationships.Detect information leakage: Use the PPS matrix to
detect information leakage between variables — even if the
information leakage is mediated via other variables.Data
Normalization: Find entity structures in the data via interpreting
the PPS matrix as a directed graph. This might be surprising when the
data contains latent structures that were previously unknown. For
example: the TicketID in the Titanic dataset is often an indicator
for a family.How to use the PPS in your own (Python) projectIf you
are still following along you are one of the rare human beings who
still have an attention span — you crazy beast! If you can’t wait
to see what the PPS will reveal on your own data, we have some good
news for you: we open-sourced an implementation of the PPS as a
Python library named ppscore.Before using the Python library, please
take a moment to read through the calculation detailsInstalling the
package:pip install ppscoreCalculating the PPS for a given pandas
dataframe:import ppscore as pps
pps.score(df, "feature_column", "target_column")You can also
calculate the whole PPS matrix:pps.matrix(df)How fast is the PPS in
comparison to the correlation?Although the PPS has many advantages
over the correlation, there is some drawback: it takes longer to
calculate. But how bad is it? Does it take multiple weeks or are we
done in a couple of minutes or even seconds? When calculating a
single PPS using the Python library, the time should be no problem
because it usually takes around 10–500ms. The calculation time
mostly depends on the data types, the number of rows and the used
implementation. However, when calculating the whole PPS matrix for 40
columns this results in 40*40=1600 individual calculations which
might take 1–10 minutes. So you might want to start the calculation
of the PPS matrix in the background and go on that summer vacation
you always dreamed of! ️For our projects and datasets the
computational performance was always good enough but of course there
is room for improvement. Fortunately, we see many ways how the
calculation of the PPS can be improved to achieve speed gains of a
factor of 10–100. For example, using intelligent sampling,
heuristics or different implementations of the PPS. If you like the
PPS and are in need of a faster calculation, please reach out to
us.LimitationsWe made it — you are excited and want to show the PPS
to your colleagues. However, you know they are always so critical
about new methods. That’s why you better be prepared to know the
limitations of the PPS:The calculation is slower than the correlation
(matrix).The score cannot be interpreted as easily as the correlation
because it does not tell you anything about the type of relationship
that was found. Thus, the PPS is better for finding patterns but the
correlation is better to communicate found linear relationships.You
cannot compare the scores for different target variables in a strict
mathematical way because they are calculated using different
evaluation metrics. The scores are still valuable in the real world,
but you need to keep this in mind.There are limitations of the
components used underneath the hood. Please remember: you might
exchange the components e.g. using a GLM instead of a Decision Tree
or using ROC instead of F1 for binary classifications.If you use the
PPS for feature selection you still want to perform forward and
backward selection in addition. Also, the PPS cannot detect
interaction effects between features towards your
target.ConclusionAfter years of using the correlation we were so bold
(or crazy?) to suggest an alternative that can detect linear and
non-linear relationships. The PPS can be applied to numeric and
categoric columns and it is asymmetric. We proposed an implementation
and open-sourced a Python package. In addition, we showed the
differences to the correlation on some examples and discussed some
new insights that we can derive from the PPS matrix.Now it is up to
you to decide what you think about the PPS and if you want to use it
on your own projects. We have been using the PPS for over a year as
part of the library bamboolib where the PPS is essential to add some
advanced features and thus we wanted to share the PPS with the
broader community. Therefore, we hope to receive your feedback about
the concept and we would be thrilled if you try the PPS on your own
data. In case that there might be a positive reception, we are happy
to hear about your requests for adjustments or improvements to the
implementation. As we mentioned before, there are many ways on how to
improve the speed and on how to adjust the PPS for more specific use
cases.Github: https://github.com/8080labs/ppscoreEmail: florian AT

# ChatGPT == fined-tuned GPT-3 model with small amount of data [[{]]
https://www.linkedin.com/posts/damienbenveniste_machinelearning-datascience-chatgpt-activity-7007019154666909696-T5WM 
Do you know how ChatGPT was trained? ChatGPT is "simply" a
fined-tuned GPT-3 model with a surprisingly small amount of data!
Moreover, ChatGPT is using 1.3B parameters where GPT-3 uses 175B
parameters! It is first fine-tuned with supervised learning and then
further fine-tuned with reinforcement learning. They hired 40 human
labelers to generate the training data. Let's dig into it!- First,
they started by a pre-trained GPT-3 model trained on a broad
distribution of Internet data (https://lnkd.in/gAUtxvrM). Then
sampled typical human prompts used for GPT collected from the OpenAI
website and asked labelers and customers to write down the correct
output. They fine-tuned the model with 12,725 labeled data. - Then,
they sampled human prompts and generated multiple outputs from the
model for each of the prompt. A labeler is then asked to rank those
outputs. The resulting data is used to train a Reward model
(https://lnkd.in/gdrzdWu3) with 33,207 prompts and ~10 times more
training samples using different combination of the ranked outputs.-
We then sample more human prompts and they are used to fine-tuned the
supervised fine-tuned model with Proximal Policy Optimization
algorithm (PPO), a Reinforcement Learning algorithm
(https://lnkd.in/gsDTWtga). The prompt is fed to the PPO model, the
Reward model generates a reward value, and the PPO model is
iteratively fine-tuned using the rewards and the prompts using 31,144
prompts data.This process is fully described in here:
https://lnkd.in/gnt9K9pu. The paper actually details a model called
InstructGPT which is described by OpenAI as a "sibling model" to
ChatGPT, so the numbers shown above may be slightly different from
the exact ones used for ChatGPT.---I offer Machine Learning

 ChatGPT is based on the GPT model, which uses the decoder
part of the Transformer architecture.The Transformer architecture has
an encoder and a decoder component, GPT uses only the decoder in
autoregressive form, which means it is optimized to predict the next
token (word) in a sequence.Optimizing for predicting the next token
causes unintended behaviors. That's why GPT3 often makes up facts,
generates biased text, or don't follow the user's intentions.This is
one of the key areas that ChatGPT fixed.Researchers at OpenAI changed
the autoregressive optimization function for the objective "follow
the user’s instructions helpfully and safely". To do this, they use
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF).In RLHF, humans
rate multiple questions and answer pairs, and rank them on quality.
This generates a reward function that is used to optimize the GPT
model with a reinforcement learning algorithm.ChatGPT was optimized
from a GPT 3.5 model, trained on Azure supercomputers. This is an
evolution of GPT3 which finished training in early 2022.See more

# R LANG TUTOR Powered by AI [[{R,QA.UX,low_code]]

Based on Davinci (ChatGPT's sibling) from OpenAI, I wrote an app
called RTutor (http://RTutor.ai) that can generate and
test R code just by "chatting" with it.
 For example, given the mpg dataset, you can ask questions like:
- "Are SUVs more fuel efficient than compact cars?"
- "Conduct ANOVA of log-transformed hwy by class and drv."
- "Use ggplot2 to create a boxplot of hwy vs. class. Color by class. Add jitter."

 RTutor will then generate functional code to answer your question,
making it easy for those without R experience to conduct preliminary
analysis and visualization of their data. For those with R coding
experience, RTutor can save you time by providing code that you can
use as a starting point for your projects.RTutor can be run locally
as an R package (https://lnkd.in/gtnkuemW). It also generates R
Markdown code and html reports, like this one
(https://lnkd.in/giEuNTzA). I have to say, I'm still in disbelief at
how well this tool (mostly OpenAI's credit) works. It's like magic!
Christmas magic!P.S. As it went viral, I edited this post with the
help of ChatGPT. Crazy world! This is a personal side project not
related to work. For work, I am looking for graduate students to join

# Tabular data vs graphs  [[{]]
https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tonyseale_graphs-graphneuralnetworks-neuralnetworks-activity-7004371666139000833-ctmf
Tony Seale Knowledge Graph Engineer at UBS1
Tabular datasets have a lot of values in them, but they do not have
explicit information about the connective structure of ‘the
system’ in which those values exist. As a result, our AI models can
often make predictions that lack a sense of context. Graphs treat
connections as first-class citizens, and many Graph Neural Networks
use a process called message passing, where each node in the graph
makes a prediction and then passes that prediction on through its
connections. This process is then repeated so that each neuron can
take the predictions of its neighbours into account in the next
iteration. In other words, each neuron takes its local context into
account. There is a deep and pleasing harmony to using a graph
structure throughout the whole process. Graph Neural Networks use
graphs for input, computation and output. These graphs are
expressive, they model connections, and those connections provide
context. Context can often be critical to finding the answer we seek.
It is what allows us to see the nuance and ambiguity between a simple
yes or no. Life is not black and white: context provides us with
those all-important shades of grey. In fact, Graph Neural Networks
can give us ‘technicoloured’ answers. See how GNNs can be
incorporated into your wider data network: https://lnkd.in/eyJuFNci

# DATA CATALOGS ("Data Stores") [[{]]
 Data Catalogs provide what some describe Data Stores for data.
 However, it turns out that shopping for data is rather like shopping
for individual pieces of Lego: it only becomes useful and worthwhile
when the pieces are connected together.The answer is surprisingly
simple. A shared definition of what a data catalog is can enable
standardisation, reduce dataset staleness, pave the way for
integration with downstream tools and can eventually deliver ‘Lego
like’ dataset connectivity.This article explores how organisations
can use the definition of a data catalog in schema.org to invert the
cost of data integration and build a Connected Data Catalog:

# Target vs Feature  [[{]]
https://www.linkedin.com/posts/venkat-raman-analytics_statistics-datascience-econometrics-activity-7001877969824616448-fliq 
 An interesting pattern I have observed is that, people without
statistical or related background predominantly use the term 'Target'
and 'Feature'. People with statistical and related background used
the following for Dependent and Independent variable: Dependent
variable : Regressand, Predicted, Endogenous, Target, Response,
Explained Variable Independent variable: Regressor, Predictor,
Exogenous, Feature, Covariate, Explanatory VariableNow I don't want
to be pedantic about this and I am not advocating that there is only
one ideal term to use.I am just sharing this knowledge only on a
'good to know' basis and perhaps to allay some misconceptions. Also I
believe knowing the etymology and background behind this naming
convention will perhaps help you appreciate the subject better.I will
talk about four terms in this post (any more will perhaps warrant an
article). Independent variable and Dependent variable: Misconception:
They are named so because the dependent variable is 'dependent' on a
set of variables - 'the independent variables'. And the independent
variables are 'independent' of each other and the dependent
variable.Explanation: The names 'independent' and 'dependent'
variable came about in context of controlled experimental studies. If
one read RA Fischer's work (Arrangement of Field Experiments or
Statistical methods for research workers), we can see that there were
studies on crop growth pattern vis a vis the treatment of
fertilizers.In these cases, the choice of fertilizers or say type of
soil were chosen independently. This is how the name 'independent'
came about.Many say the Independent and Dependent variable is poor
terminology. The relationship is never unidirectional. In a
statistical sense, the independent variables are not 'independent' of
each other or the dependent variable. Also, one should not make the
mistake of assuming causality because of the terms IV and DV.In the
context of linear regression, perhaps it best to think of it as
Expected value of Y (mean) being conditioned on X.The formulaic
structure is given asE(Y|X)=β0+β1X. Endogenous and Exogeneous
variables: The term 'Endogenous and Exogeneous' is predominantly used
in the context of Structural Equation Modeling (SEM).It must be kept
in mind that, these terms are rarely used in context of linear
regression. The reason being, exogenous by definition means variables
that are not affected by any other variable. However they do affect
the Endogenous variable. Also, Endogenous variable in no way affect
exogenous variables.

# Wasserstein distance  [[{]]

Danny B.3rd Chief Data Scientist
- Wasserstein distance: (also called Kantorovich–Rubinstein metric):
  A way to measure the distance between two probability distributions
  on a metric space M.
- Intuitively, if each distribution is viewed as a unit amount of earth
  (soil) piled on M, the metric is the "minimum cost" of turning one
  pile into the other, which is assumed to be the amount of earth that
  needs to be moved times the mean distance it has to be moved.
- This problem only makes sense if the pile to be created has the same
  mass as the pile to be moved.
- The name "Wasserstein distance" was coined by R. L. Dobrushin in 1970,
  after learning of it in the work of Leonid Vaseršteĭn on Markov
  processes. However, the metric was first defined by Leonid
  Kantorovich. Consequently, some encourage using the terms
  "Kantorovich metric" and "Kantorovich distance." Most
  English-language publications use the German spelling "Wasserstein"
  (attributed to the name "Vaseršteĭn" being of German
  origin).Applications in Data Science and Machine LearningIn the paper
  'Wasserstein GAN,' Arjovsky et al. use the Wasserstein-1 metric to
  improve the original framework of Generative Adversarial Networks
  (GAN) and alleviate the vanishing gradient and mode collapse issues.

  earizon: this distance looks more like "work". Can we see
  "scalars" as some sort of special distance?

# Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) [[{02_doc_has.decission_tree]]
https://www.linkedin.com/posts/danny-butvinik_datascience-machinelearning-activity-7005131810712006656-TSkV 
Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) aims to find a well-performing
hyperparameter configuration of a given machine learning model on a
dataset (including the model, its hyperparameters, and other data
processing steps).In Data Science and Machine Learning, a
"hyperparameter" is a parameter whose value controls the learning
process. By contrast, the values of other parameters are derived via
training. GridSearch An exhaustive method measured by
cross-validation on the training dataset. It is a simple,
time-consuming, and efficient approach with only categorical HPs.
Random SearchReplaces exhaustive search by selecting randomly. It is
embarrassingly parallel and more efficient than grid search. It does
not consider previous results and is not efficient with conditional
HPs. Bayesian Optimization and Variants Builds a probabilistic model
of the function mapping from hyperparameters values to the objectives
evaluated on a validation set. By evaluating a promising
hyperparameter configuration based on the current model and then
updating it, Bayesian Optimization hopes to get as many observations
as possible that show as much as possible about this function and, in
particular, where the optimal point is. Bayesian
Optimization-Gaussian Processes (BO-GP)Converge fast for continuous
hyperparameters. However, it has a poor parallelization capacity and
is inefficient with conditional hyperparameters. Bayesian
Optimization Tree-structured Parzen Estimators (BO-TPE)Efficient with
all types of hyperparameters and keeps conditional dependencies, but
has a poor capacity for parallelization. Tree-structured Parzen
Estimators (TPE)Sequential Model-based Optimization (SMBO) methods
sequentially construct models to approximate the performance of
hyperparameters based on historical measurements, and then choose new
hyperparameters to test based on this model. HyperBandEarly
stopping-based method that adaptively allocates a pre-defined
resource, e.g., iterations, data samples, or several features, to
randomly sampled configurations. It enables parallelization but could
be more efficient with conditional hyperparameters. Bayesian
Optimization HyperBand (BOHB)It is a state-of-the-art HPO algorithm.
The idea behind the BOHB is based on one simple question – why do
we run successive halving repeatedly? Instead of a blind repetition
method on top of successive halving, BOHB uses the Bayesian
Optimization algorithm. BOHB combines HyperBand and Bayesian
Optimization to use both of these algorithms efficiently. It is
efficient with all types of hyperparameters. Successive
HalvingAttempts to allocate the most funds to the most promising
methods. It assumes all configurations could be stopped early, and a
validation score could be obtained. There is a trade-off between how
many configurations need to be selected at the start and how many
cuts are needed.

# ML [2210.05189] Neural Networks are Decision Trees
  https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05189
  Caglar Aytekin
  In this manuscript, we show that any neural network with any
  activation function can be represented as a decision tree. The
  representation is equivalence and not an approximation, thus keeping
  the accuracy of the neural network exactly as is. We believe that
  this work provides better understanding of neural networks and paves
  the way to tackle their black-box nature. We share equivalent trees
  of some neural networks and show that besides providing
  interpretability, tree representation can also achieve some
  computational advantages for small networks. The analysis holds both
  for fully connected and convolutional networks, which may or may not
  also include skip connections and/or normalizations.

# AI Memory: What Makes a Neural Network Remember?  [[{]]
https://neurosciencenews.com/biological-neural-network-memory-22729/
AI Memory: What Makes a Neural Network Remember?
classic neural network, researchers have created a new artificial
intelligence model based on recent biological findings that shows
improved memory performance.Source: OISTComputer models are an
important tool for studying how the brain makes and stores memories
and other types of complex information. But creating such models is a
tricky business. Somehow, a symphony of signals – both biochemical
and electrical –  and a tangle of connections between neurons and
other cell types creates the hardware for memories to take hold. Yet
because neuroscientists don’t fully understand the underlying
biology of the brain, encoding the process into a computer model in
order to study it further has been a challenge. Now, researchers at
the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST) have altered a
commonly used computer model of memory called a Hopfield network in a
way that improves performance by taking inspiration from  biology .
They found that not only does the new network better reflect how
neurons and other cells wire up in the brain, it can also hold
dramatically more memories.The complexity added to the network is
what makes it more realistic, says Thomas Burns, a PhD student in the
group of Professor Tomoki Fukai, who heads OIST’s Neural Coding and
Brain Computing Unit. “Why would biology have all this complexity?
Memory capacity might be a reason,” Mr. Burns says. Hopfield
networks store memories as patterns of weighted connections between
different neurons in the system. The network is “trained” to
encode these patterns, then researchers can test its memory of them
by presenting a series of blurry or incomplete patterns and seeing if
the network can recognize them as one it already knows.In classical
Hopfield networks, however, neurons in the model reciprocally connect
to other neurons in the network to form a series of what are called
“pairwise” connections. Pairwise connections represent how two
neurons connect at a synapse, a connection point between two neurons
in the brain. But in reality, neurons have intricate branched
structures called dendrites that provide multiple points for
connection, so the brain relies on a much more complex arrangement of
synapses to get its cognitive jobs done. Additionally, connections
between neurons are modulated by other cell types called
astrocytes.“It’s simply not realistic that only pairwise
connections between neurons exist in the brain,” explains Mr.
Burns. He created a modified Hopfield network in which not just pairs
of neurons but sets of three, four, or more neurons could link up
too, such as might occur in the brain through astrocytes and
dendritic trees. Although the new network allowed these so-called
“set-wise” connections, over all it contained the same total
number of connections as before.The researchers found that a network
containing a mix of both pairwise and set-wise connections performed
best and retained the highest number of memories. They estimate it
works more than doubly as well as a traditional Hopfield network.
“It turns out you actually need a combination of features in some
balance,” says Mr. Burns. “You should have individual synapses,
but you should also have some dendritic trees and some
astrocytes.”Spinal Cord Stimulation Instantly Improves Arm Mobility
After StrokeThey found that not only does the new network better
reflect how neurons and other cells wire up in the brain, it can also
hold dramatically more memories. Image is in the public domain
Hopfield networks are important for modeling brain processes, but
they have powerful other uses too. For example, very similar types of
networks called Transformers underlie AI-based language tools such as
ChatGPT, so the improvements Mr. Burns and Professor Fukai have
identified may also make such tools more robust.Mr. Burns and his
colleagues plan to continue working with their modified Hopfield
networks to make them still more powerful . For example, in the brain
the strengths of connections between neurons are not normally the
same in both directions, so Mr. Burns wonders if this feature of
asymmetry might also improve the network’s performance.
Additionally, he would like to explore ways of making the network’s
memories interact with each other, the way they do in the human
brain._

# Categorical Correlation: [[{]]
 Several years ago I started looking for my first Data Scientist role. I didn't had any experience as one, so I did the only thing I could think of to gain some knowledge - I started playing around with some data and wrote blogposts on Medium about what I found.One of my first blogposts was about Categorical Correlation. Surprised I couldn't find implementations of these on Scikit-learn or SciPy, I implemented them myself, wrapped them as a Python package and uploaded it to GitHub and PyPi. I named it Dython. Ever since, I've been maintaining the code, fixing bugs and adding new features.A few days ago I got an email from PyPI itself, mentioning Dython has been designated as a critical project - meaning it has been in the top 1% of downloads over the previous 6 months. It is used today in dozens of projects worldwide, including open-source projects by Yandex, Gretel.ai and The Alan Turing Institute.The little things you do matter in the long run.Oh, and yes - I did got a job as a Data Scientist :)

# ChatGPT explained [[{]]
  Cassie Kozyrkov, Chief Decision Scientist at Google, Keynote Speaker
  (bit.ly/makecassietalk)
Creator of the Making Friends with Machine Learning series Today, I
want to demystify ChatGPT - a fascinating new application of GANs
(Generative Adversarial Networks) that has been generating a lot of
buzz in the AI community.For those unfamiliar with GANs, they are a
type of neural network that uses two competing networks - a generator
and a discriminator - to create realistic-looking outputs. The
generator creates fake outputs, and the discriminator tries to tell
the difference between the fake outputs and real-world data. Through
this back-and-forth process, the GAN is able to produce outputs that
are indistinguishable from real data.ChatGPT takes this concept and
applies it to text-based conversation. It uses GANs to generate
responses to input text, allowing it to engage in natural-sounding
conversations with humans.But here's the catch - ChatGPT's responses
only touch reality at a tangent. While they may sound convincing,
they are ultimately fictional creations of the GAN.This might sound
like a drawback, but it actually makes ChatGPT incredibly useful.
Because it isn't tied to the constraints of reality, ChatGPT can
engage in completely imaginary conversations and provide creative,
out-of-the-box responses.For example, you could ask ChatGPT what it
would do if it could fly, and it might respond with something like "I
would soar through the skies like a majestic eagle, feeling the wind
beneath my wings and the freedom of flight." This type of response
would be impossible for a human to come up with, but it's perfectly
within the realm of possibility for ChatGPT.So, why use ChatGPT if
its responses only touch reality at a tangent? Because sometimes,
it's exactly this type of creative, imaginative thinking that we need
to solve complex problems and generate new ideas. ChatGPT allows us
to explore possibilities that are beyond the constraints of our
everyday reality, and that can be incredibly powerful.So, there you
have it - ChatGPT demystified! While its responses may not always be
rooted in reality, they are still incredibly useful for generating
creative ideas and engaging in imaginative conversations. I hope
you'll give it a try and see what new possibilities it can unlock for
you.

If you have ever encountered unexpected patterns and inconsistencies while running a complex supervised machine learning model, you may have found your results to be unreliable.

This is a common issue that can perplex even the most experienced data scientists.
Fortunately, there is a relatively new approach that can help you discover the underlying structure of your data: topological data analysis (TDA).
This article (link in the first comment) compares TDA with popular t-SNE and UMAP packages and explain why TDA achieves significantly better results. It has the ability to unveil the unexpected and restore order to your results.
