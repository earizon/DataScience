Who is Who:
(Forcibly incomplete but still quite pertinent list of core people and companies)
 - Yoshua Bengio, Geoffrey Hinton y Yann LeCun, knows as the godfathers of IA, rewarded with  Turing Price
   - Yoshua Bengio (with Ian Goodfellow) is author also of http://www.deeplearningbook.org/.
   - Geoffrey Hinton invented with two partners the retroprogramming algorithm core in modern techniques of 
     neural network programming.
     In 2009 he managed to developd a Neu.Net. for voice recognition much better that anything 
     existing at that moment. 3 years later probed Neu.Nets could recognise images with better 
     precission than any other current technology.
   - Yann LeCun made important contributions to the retroprogramming algorithms created by Geoffrey Hilton.
     Before that, in 1989, he created LeNet-5m a well-known system for recognition of written 
     characters in bank checks that at the time represented a great advance in optical character 
     recognition.
